1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What's up guys, we're here again with BJJ and little stunning here. Sorry, my hair, my beard are all messed up again this time.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I get a chance to cut it before I came. So, sorry, you're going to have to deal with this.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
As of right now, I've been working on the system for like the last year and a half.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And let's talk about what the system is and what, what, why develop it first of all, okay?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's going to be a combination of other Toriado system, like so, with a camping subsystem where I camp and I hang out on my part as J point, which will talk about it a little while.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And a combination of a high step series from both reverse and an outside deliva, like so, to get past my corner's hip and past my corner shoulder line.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, so that's just a basic general idea.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's look at why I developed the system in the first place.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Back, like 2015, 2014, 2015, all I really did was leg locks and scrambled to the back.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But my game was built around attacking the legs and it was very little guard passing in there.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It got to a point where everyone in Henzos was so good at leg locks that they came almost impossible to smidden me with leg locks.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So now it's okay, well this is no good. I'm scoring fewer and fewer submissions per round.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How can I up my, my submission percentage?

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So I started passing people's guards. So if I can pass the guards, I can pin them and I can take their back and then I can finish them.

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So I started using body lock passing, okay, and that was successful. I worked for six, eight months and it was great.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I would lock my hands out and ask people to body locks. Then everyone started to get kind of hip to that and they realized, okay, the corner knots is handy.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So whatever I started doing, the story keeping hands inside, knees inside, and big body locks incredibly hard to get to.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Or they just flat out started playing a simpon game where now there's no lower back exposure and I couldn't actually go in and lock body locks in my partner.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I said, okay, what the hell I do now?

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So I started playing game where I forced people into half-guard where however, maybe they ended up in half-guard.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then I'll get some kind of control of the upper body where I passed the leg and I go and I control the head.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I switched my hands and I go and I control the head and I would use that and start passing their guards.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And then they got to a point where they started doing a really good job of keeping inside position and half-guard.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I couldn't come forward anymore and I couldn't get to upper body inside position.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So then I was like, well, what the hell do I do now? I can't pass the body lock and I can't pass a linear into half-guard.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So then when I started doing, I started using a torreado game.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I would tour around though, the outside of my partner's legs and I started out plugging them and passing.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then it became increasingly harder and harder to get outside of my partner's legs and pass the hip line.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So then I started developing a camping game where I'd tour on the one way and then I started going across my partner's legs and having the risk of re-engagement.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I would start camping on my partner's hip line like so. So I could spend more and more time pass the hip and pass the shoulder line.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then it came to a point where my trainer partner got so good, where I would go for the initial torreado.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My partners started opening up their legs and making it impossible for me to even outflank them.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So then this leads me into my high-step series where if I can't outflank my partner who likes to reach in towards me,

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
you go in, so we start playing a high-step game.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Parkinson's are going in and passing my partner's legs.

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is initially why developed this passing system that you haven't really seen this too much in competition.

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You saw a little bit in my Roberto match, in my full on my fill, bro match, but you haven't really seen it because number one, I've just been working on it recently and developing it.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And my stomach was less too bad so I stopped competing for a while, so you haven't really seen it.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Another reason why you really haven't seen it is because the more basic your opponents are, the more basic your moves have to be.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And most of my opponents are terrible, so I've never got to this level of sophistication when I, when I'm working that passing guys in competition.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because I go out and they just allow me to bodylock them right away or force them into half guard right away and immediately pass their guards.

42
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Um, I've never, I've never gotten to a point where I couldn't tour down the way guy couldn't lock my hands in a half guard or bodylock and had to start high-step thing, I would just go out and easily pass their guards.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So the level of sophistication with guard plays not at a level where it would merit me to use such an advanced passing series.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Um, in addition, I'm in a heavyweight bracket, most of the time we're almost a play bottom position. So I want to spend most of the time in a match and places that would lead to submission.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Instead of going out and fighting a guy for three, five, six, seven minutes on take downs and then having three minutes to work.

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I rather just go out, sit to guard and spend the ten, full ten minutes trying to submit the guys that are wrestling first and then trying to go down to the floor later with the less amount of time to work.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So I just go out and I sit to guard and I do either leg locks or backtakes and I do most of my work from bottom position. You don't only see me passing too much.

48
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can see why you haven't seen me use this. It's because of the fact that if you look at my matches, everyone knows I'm a very good guard passer.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So what they try to do is everyone just wants to knock it submitted, right?

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Everyone tries to do is instead of playing guard, usually there's an unspoken role where one guy is the passer and one is the guard player.

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
They'll break this unspoken role and they'll just try to stand up and see this very clearly in both of my Wagner matches.

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You can see it in the Tim Sprykes match where guys just try to freak out and stand up and get away from me.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So you're now your primary goal is to avoid submissions and pass your partner's guard.

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's to hold your partner down and you can actually attempt to do a guard pass.

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So when your partner tries to get up and get away from you and stand up in a way, it's an arc in keeping your partner down and you change your guard passing based around this.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So the focus now is it's changed from passing the guy's guard to holding the guy down.

57
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You have to change your passing style a little bit and we'll talk about this in the future in a different different series.

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
More of a scrim and dressing series but we'll talk about it eventually in the future.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you haven't really seen this kind of passing because my partners are so terrible or my partners are so terrible that I can just easily lock my hands and pass the guards and they're trying to get up in a way for me.

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I usually overextending trying to push away and that allows me to get some form of connection with the upper body, whether it be with a body lock or with a top head and arm, things like that double under hooks.

61
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Because they're overextending so much trying to stand up that I can actually lock my hands and work more basic passes that you know most of us have seen.

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So we're going to experiment now with more advanced passing systems and I have someone who's very, very good at keeping upper body inside position and now not allowing me to get.

63
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Either connection at the waist or connection on the upper body, making it very hard for me to start flanking my partner.

64
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You know, you always deal with those guys there. You feel like you go to engage the guard and they're like dumb be and they're so flexible and you feel like just nothing you can do to get past our guard.

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Those are the guys we're looking to pass now guys, but incredibly good guard retention.

66
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's very hard with guys who are very hard to make a connection at the upper body or at the hips with body locks.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Alright, so let's look at this new philosophy I have when we're talking about guard passing.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Now this is going to eat a loose passing series. It's not going to be body lock or half guard passing, it's just going to be based around a loose series of flanking and high step.

69
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
If you look at the number one thing that your partner needs to effectively play a guard against you, what is it?

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a connection of their legs to your body, okay?

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If your partner can't form a connection to your body with their legs, they have no guard.

72
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Any guard requires some form of connection to your body with their legs. If they can't do that, they can't play a guard.

73
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So I got into a habit mentally of whatever my partner forms a meaningful connection to my body with her legs.

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It throws up red flags in my head and I'm thinking what is the fastest way I can disengage my partner's legs and flag them.

75
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So every time I forth my partner forms some kind of connection whether she grabs an ankle, like so, and she wraps up with Alfred Delihiva, any time I partner forms any meaningful connection, I'm like, okay, this siren's going off my head.

76
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How can I disconnect and fly?

77
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I partner doesn't do an ashigurami.

78
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No good, this connection to my life. How can I disconnect and flag?

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So I just play this game just by thinking to yourself, never let your partner form a connection to your body with their legs.

80
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If you have the means to do this through skills and knowledge, it's going to be incredibly hard and incredibly exhausting for your partner to do anything.

81
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There's nothing more tiring than your partner constantly pulling needs to chest.

82
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Trying to engage your legs to you, the legs are just flopping around and your constantly side to side and their legs can't form a connection to you.

83
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's nothing worse. I probably trying to engage me, the whole time the legs just can't form a connection. This is exhausting for your partner.

84
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So I don't spend time in front of my partner where legs are engaging me.

85
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I spend time in flagging positions where it's incredibly hard for my partner to get anywhere close to me.

86
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And this is the philosophy we're talking about.

87
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's disallowing your partner to form a convenient connection with their legs to your body.

88
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're looking to spend more time. Pass our opponent's hip and pass our opponent's shoulder line.

89
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then time spent engaging my partner's legs. The ideal, this is obviously very hard to accomplish.

90
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The ideal in a match. It's to spend more time camping. We'll talk about camping as I can.

91
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Camping passion partners, hip line and camping passion partners shoulder line. Then your partner, then time spent engage inside your partner's guard.

92
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, so if I can spend more time in this position in a match, then I can spend in this position or in this position or in this position or in this position.

93
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
In a match, you're going to win this match. You're going to pass your partner's guard.

94
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So that's the ideal. That's where striving towards.

95
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So if we can't achieve that, we have a vision of what we're trying to do.

96
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay, now let's talk about J point or J spot camping.

97
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
First of all, what is the J point?

98
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's a critical demarcation line on your partner's body. Where if you walk past that point, your partner is in jeopardy of having that guard past.

99
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay.

100
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This line is the one that draws the hips together. The hip line.

101
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Anytime, I can get past the hip line from this point forwards.

102
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My partner's in real jeopardy of having her guard past and she has to give me a real reaction otherwise it's going to be passed.

103
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Right now, this elicits no reaction.

104
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If I step, she might partner's hip line. This elicits almost no reaction.

105
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If I step past my partner's hip line, this elicits a huge reaction.

106
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We're now, I'm perpendicular to my partner. She can no longer engage me in the legs and so she puts herself back in front of me.

107
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And now from here, she can go and start to engage actively into a guard.

108
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So, what I'm looking to do is to constantly find ways to flank my partner and move past my partner's J point, which is the hip line, like so.

109
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And even better, past my partner's shoulder line, like so.

110
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If I can do that, it is going to be very hard and very exhausting for your partner to maintain guard.

111
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Now, so we're going to look at an idea called camping, where I physically just can't.

112
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I park myself on my partner's J point. We're going to look at more and more of this in a few minutes.

113
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Where I physically can't, in positions like so. So, my partner who has been tangling me with the legs, she's using a ton of energy.

114
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm using none. Okay. So, I can, how my partner's J point for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 seconds at a time.

115
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Until my partner just so exhausted, she just needs to drift away from the chest.

116
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You pass your partner's guard. Now, it's so exhausted. It's pretty easy to work through a submission. Okay.

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So, between the ideas of flanking your partner and not allowing them to connect the legs and meaningful ways to your body.

118
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And constantly working to camp on your partner's J point or beyond the hip or beyond the shoulder line are super super, super important.

119
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There's a couple of athletes who actually do this very well.

120
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The kings of this are the men's brothers. They work really, really well.

121
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Walking past the hip one, the footwork is beautiful. They do it a lot in the knee.

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Moving past the hip one, moving past the shoulder one. They put a drastic amount of pressure on side to side.

123
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm on, on their partner. But they do it with a movement base game. There's two ways you can camp at your partner's hip line. You can do it with a movement base game where you walk from side to side.

124
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Or you work around your partner's head and you walk it to north south and side to side control.

125
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Or you can do it with a negation of movement game where I physically camp and I don't move.

126
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Once I get past my partner's hip line, I don't move.

127
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay, so playing with these two ideas of constantly walking past your partner's hip line and shoulder line and camping past that point.

128
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Staying past that point is going to be an idea if you play with that and you can constantly walk past the hip one.

129
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's going to be incredibly hard for your partner to maintain guard.

130
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And at that any point, your partner engages the legs in a meaningful way. So it's going to pressure on you or off balance here.

131
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
These throughout red flags and your head and you say, "Man, this is not good. What's the fastest and most effective way?"

132
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can disengage my legs and immediately outflank my partner to move beyond the straight point past the hip or past the shoulder line.

133
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you work with these two ideas, it's a very simple idea.

134
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And everyone knows this. Okay, she knows that you're trying to outflank her and if you do, it's going to be difficult for her to maintain guard.

135
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So this is the game you're playing. She knows that she doesn't want to get outflank and you know that you want to outflank her.

136
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But if you can just keep these two simple ideas in your head throughout this entire series, everything's going to become much, much easier.

137
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They're very simple, not easy to accomplish, but they're simple ideas to work with and now we need the skills and knowledge to be able to implement these ideas.

138
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So let's talk about a cranial shift.

139
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I mentioned this before. What is a cranial shift?

140
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We talked about cranial shifts actually in the first passing instructional, systematically attacking the guard.

141
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But we didn't have a name for it back then.

142
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's talk about one of the goals being pinning your partner's upper body controlling the head and the shoulders.

143
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Either before you pass the legs or after you pass the legs.

144
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And this is what a cranial shift is at some point.

145
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You have to go from passing your partner's legs to controlling the head and shoulders.

146
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay, and you treat and pass your partner's guard technically without controlling the head and shoulders.

147
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But you can't really pass our guard in a meaningful way where you can isolate limbs and attack them unless you make a cranial shifts.

148
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And so what that means is by the body's up, for example.

149
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And you see this in the homelo match 2017. I pass, you can pass your opponent's guard with control of your partner's weight.

150
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So your pass your partner's legs technically yes, your pass your partner's guard, your partner's guard, your perpendicular.

151
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
She doesn't have the legs engaged anymore, you score your points and you pass your partner's guard.

152
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But doesn't mean anything until you make a cranial shift where I go from passing the legs to shifting to the head.

153
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I make this cranial shift where I come up and I go from the passing the legs to controlling the head and shoulders.

154
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And if I can't do this, like in my homelo match and I come out and I try to switch and he brings hands and side and now you can regard, I can't attack it.

155
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can't attack her upper body and isolate limbs in any meaningful way unless I control the head and the shoulders.

156
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
So we're going to talk about making this cranial shift while we're passing where we go from passing her partner's legs.

157
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can control the head and shoulders. It's easy to pass your partner's legs.

158
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How many times do you see matches in live training or competition, guys passing the legs?

159
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Happens all the time.

160
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Who I stand up, I tore it on though, I passed the legs.

161
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm passed my partner's legs right now.

162
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But passing the legs, getting past the legs, and actually passing the guard are two different days.

163
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If I can't control the head and the shoulders, I can't pass my partner's guard. I have to make a cranial shift.

164
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So passing the legs and actually performing a cranial shift in passing your partner's guard are two very different things.

165
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And we have to understand that when we're passing.

166
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So that's what a cranial shift is.

167
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Now, let's look at distinguishing between certain types of passes.

168
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We can pass into a side control, we can pass into mount, and we can pass into north south.

169
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Now, this becomes very interesting.

170
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
When I pass into side control, when I pass into mount, I have to perform a cranial shift. Why is this?

171
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
When I, in order to pass, there's no way I can effectively pass my partner's guard into side control or to mount.

172
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then, use it to attack them.

173
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay, so with distinguishing between just passing their guard to score points and passing their guard to actually attack her attack and submit your guard.

174
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There's a two different things.

175
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If I want to attack and submit my partner, I have to make a cranial shift when I pass the side control or to mount.

176
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And there's no other way around this.

177
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Okay, if I want to attack the upper body.

178
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But when you pass to north south of your passenger partner's shoulder line, this is the exception.

179
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is why passing to north south is much easier if you look at competition.

180
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's much easier for a high level guys to pass to north south against an incredibly good guard player who is good at keeping upper body inside position.

181
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Because when you pass to north south, you don't need to make a cranial shift.

182
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Passing to north south is the only pass when you don't have to actually control your partner's head and your shoulders to actually get pass your partner's guard and attack them in a meaningful way.

183
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When I pass into north south, I don't have to control the head.

184
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If he has a knees up, all I have to do is beat those knees, beat the elbows, coming with my hips.

185
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And now I've successfully passed my partner's guard.

186
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And now I'm passed the legs, I'm passed the guard without controlling the head in any way.

187
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I have to enjoy my partner's arms.

188
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And now I can start doing it and attack my partner's arms without having any direct control over my partner's head.

189
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So cranial shift has super, super important when you're looking to pass into side control or into mouth, which is a large part of what we're going to be doing today.

190
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But if you're looking to pass, if your pass your partner's shoulder line, then you're passing into north south.

191
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And you don't need to have a cranial shift, the north south pass is the one exception to the cranial shift.

192
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So if you're passing when you're passing the hip line on the J point down here, and you're passing into mouth and side control, you need to have a cranial shift to where you go from passing the legs to controlling the head in shoulders.

193
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you're passing to north south, you don't need a cranial shift, and you can pass successfully pass your partner's legs past the guard.

194
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And isolate limbs without direct control in the head.

195
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
[Music]

196
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Alright, I'm going to present the very hard to small pill for some of you out there.

197
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And you're not going to like what I'm going to, I'm about to say, but it's a fact and there's no way around this.

198
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If you guys want to become a true guard passing master, if you want to reach your true potential as a guard passer,

199
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you have to become a master, or at least incredibly competent at leg locking, and why is this?

200
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If you play a game where you're trying to pass someone's guard, and you know that if they enter into any kind of Aussie or army, they're going to leg lock you.

201
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They're going to sit down to the butt or sit down to your butt, and then go into attacking your legs, and you're going to freak out to get out of the way.

202
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Or if they get into some kind of Aussie or army, you're so afraid that you rip out of the Aussie or army, and you run away and you reset.

203
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're never going to reach your full guard passing potential. You're always going to play a timid game where your feet and legs are back in a way from your partner.

204
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
When you play a relatively low passing game, and every time someone cuts your legs, you swallow legs back in a way, you run out in a way you disengage, and then you go back into your partner's guard.

205
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This takes away a very large portion of your passing material.

206
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You have to carry on those that are hard to do. Someone inverses into your legs, and you freak out. The highest thing is out of the equation.

207
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There's a lot of passing that you won't be able to do if you're afraid of getting your legs into it.

208
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And even if you do this passing, and someone enters into an Aussie or army, for example, and even if you can rip out in a way, let's say, okay, I don't.

209
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm afraid, if my partner says me down for me, she's going to leg lock me, I'm afraid of leg locks. I feel like she's much better than I am. Even if at any point, you can be like, okay, I can just bail, and I can kick my leg out and run away.

210
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's counterproductive to the passing guard. You're moving away from your partner. It's much better to be able to stay in the pocket.

211
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And passage, and that you can go into actual passage from here. And knowing that worst case scenario, your partner sits you down, tries to go into attacks in your legs, and you just repomble and you break your partner's leg.

212
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So you have to be able to have the confidence that if you try to do these passes, and not just these passes, other passes as well, and your partner enters into your legs, and tries to play leg lock, a leg lock and game with you.

213
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can either, for the bare minimum, stay in the pocket, disengage your legs, and put real passing pressure on your partner, or worst case scenario, your partner sits you down to the butt, tries to leg lock you, and you just repomble, get back on top, or repomble, and then go into attacks in your own partner's legs, and counter leg lock your partner.

214
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You're never ever going to reach your full guard passing potential unless you're highly competent or an expert at leg locking, and there's just no other way around this.

215
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:17,000
To pass with a passing, a standing manner when you're going as a strong, strong leg locker. If I try to do these high stuff passing, I'm sorry, playing a game from here, and then, for example, I lose my partner's partner's far-light, and she goes to start inverting, or out my leg leg, so if you, if you're, you know, freak out for me, like, oh, no, my legs ain't get broken. This is not what we want. You should be able to stay calm and know that you're going to be able to pass your partner's guard from here, even when she goes to even when things go south, and she gets into your leg.

216
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Well, worst case scenario, you can repomble the legs and get out. You can counter leg lock your partner, and so on and so forth. So understand that, if you're looking to master, especially this high stepping system, where I use a Toriando game, and I use a game where I'm high stepping out of my partner's guard, and my legs are presented to my partner.

217
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:48,000
If you want to master this style of passing specifically, and all guard passing, you have to become a highly competent, if not an expert in the area of leg locker.

218
00:24:48,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And I'm sorry to tell you that to some of you because I know you're not going to like it, but it's true, and there's no other way around this, and the fast you accept this, the faster you can progress in terms of guard passing.

219
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Alright, so let's look at a quick little overview of what we're going to be looking at in this in this passive series, and the how the breakdown's going to go.

220
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The first thing we're going to look at, everything is going to be passing an opponent from a simpon guard.

221
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Alright, we're going to be working on, I'm going to be standing, and my opponent's going to be simpon.

222
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If my opponent is seated, we use all of the stuff we're using in the previous system athletes attacking the guard, the first version.

223
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm always principal storming the same. This, this is just an addition to that, so I'm not saying just to use these and then don't use anything that I showed to those all the same concepts still apply.

224
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I think I haven't watched it, I'm assuming you have.

225
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You haven't watched, I recommend watching that one first, so you get the general idea of passing, and this is a more advanced and more advanced series.

226
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:59,000
But all the same, all the same ideas apply, still fainting with the lead legs still going in body locking and hand by and all that, but this one is built around,

227
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Torgon those and highest that passing, so we're going to be doing everything against a simpon opponent like so.

228
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The first thing we're going to look at is fainting, and we're going to go into depth in all these sub-experts, we're just going to run through the overview right now.

229
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The first thing we're going to look at is fainting with Torgon does, where I use various things, yes, my partner.

230
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Off-bounds and I get tensed through my partner's legs, okay.

231
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Won't be at the same thing, and then we're going to go into basic Torgon does, which we've already talked about.

232
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But we're going to start to review them and then go into how I can use Torgon does to move into situations or get start camping on my partner's J point.

233
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So when you use fainks to start to get tension on my partner's legs, they're going to use Torgon does to outflank my partner, and then we're going to use camping scenarios where I outflank my partner.

234
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And I move to this J point camping that we're talking about, and we'll expand upon it in a little while, okay.

235
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Then once we start once we get through the camping series, then we're going to go into the high step series, both from.

236
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:19,000
First, Elohim position like so, and an outside Elohim position like so, and then we'll work on passing both side control and to north south from all these series, and then once we finish.

237
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Once we get through all of them, then we'll look at the unification of all of these series and how they tie together into one coherent system, okay.

238
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So we'll go fainting first, get tension on my partner's legs, the Torgon does to outflank my partner, camping to stay flanked, then we'll go into high stepping, and then we'll look at the unification of all of these passing both.

239
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So I control Mount north south and then we'll move around from there.

240
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So let's look at something really interesting when you look at guard passing.

241
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:05,000
If you take the two best guard passers of all time, the two best hinners of all time, gui and no gui, it's me and hydrograisey.

242
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And if you don't want to, if you say that Gordon sucks and I don't like him, I'm watching at BBDs, but I hate him.

243
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's fine. If you don't have to think, you can leave me out of the equation. If you just look at hydrogra.

244
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:29,000
All of hydrogra is passing, he was good at all different kinds of passing, but the primary focus of all hydrogra's passing was to force a half guard chest to chest.

245
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:41,000
If he got you pinned in a chest to chest half guard and made an upper body connection with a cranial shift, he was going to pass you, he was going to mount you and he was going to finish you or take your back and finish you, okay.

246
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The overwhelming majority of my passing is to just force my partner into half guard, right? When I body lock someone, it's unlikely against a high level player.

247
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:08,000
They're going to just pass right away into a side control. But if you force half guard and you make a cranial shift, you can flatten someone out from half guard and get past that top arm and get past that top leg, it's going to be incredibly easy to pass someone.

248
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you have a direction of moving first to half guard and then passing them from half guard.

249
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Not just any half guard, specifically a chest to chest half guard where you have some kind of upper body connection, your pastor partner's cross shoulder post and your pastor partner's top leg.

250
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So a lot of this instructional, just as the entire body lock instruction was built around passing someone or forcing half guard to pass.

251
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
So this entire instructional is going to be focused around either passing someone and if I can't pass them, forcing half guard.

252
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We've talked about backtracking before we talked about it a lot and the body locking instructional.

253
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
And I haven't filmed half guard instructional right now, I'm doing a matter of order, but I'm probably going to talk about it in that one too.

254
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But I'm a big advocate of moving back into my partner's legs.

255
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I provided it on my own terms right backtrack into my partner's legs in order to go to in order to get a more advantageous position that I originally wanted.

256
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And a perfect example of this using this system is in my Roberto Jimenez match where I was touring on the one side, I tore it on the back the other side.

257
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I started camping on the J point and then he was moving moving scrambling and I presented my leg to allow him to catch half guard and I flattened them out and passed them from half guard.

258
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So forcing half guard and going back into your partner's legs and backtracking into your partner's legs provided on your own terms is one of the most effective ways we can get a strong pins and then passes after that.

259
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So we're going to use this entire series if we can't get past right to side control right to mount or right to north south.

260
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Fourcing half guard chest to chest is almost just as good, so it's going to be a big focus of what we're going to be looking at today.

261
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:04,000
All right, so let's look at engaging a simpon guard in the correct fashion.

262
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Now what I'm going to show you is not going to be like a look revolutionary or a revolutionary or anything, but it's going to make a huge difference when you're actually trying to pass the toy on those.

263
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:32,000
When I go to engage my partner in a simpon guard, I'm going to come in behind my hands, but I don't want to do is just walk in toward my partner and then she just entangles my legs and make forms of connection right away and now I'm getting off balance.

264
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So I want to come behind my hands with a staggered stance, but I don't want to hide my hands with a square stance and now if she backs my hands forward clear them anyway she has to act with both my legs.

265
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I can move behind the staggered stance so even if she backs my hands forward, she only has access to one of my legs and not to.

266
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Now in addition, when I come behind my hands, I'm going to put my hands right about mid right below midship.

267
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm going to do this with my hands to easily, I don't control her legs at all, and if I go towards the ankles, she can pop up the legs out and it's hard to control my partner's legs for any amount of time.

268
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So I go about midship, dry below midship, so she goes to pop up the legs, it's harsh made a hole to hold them and I can hold them for a little bit longer than I was just.

269
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And if I was down all the way on the ankles, okay? Now, when I go to engage my partner, even if my, even if my feet are staggered, notice here my center lines are still aligned, okay?

270
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What I want to do is I want to miss a line my center line and my partner center line, so you have two choices here.

271
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:53,000
If I want to step in between my partner's legs and split my partner's legs or a crashed center and start to go into various times of passing, where I start using where I start using.

272
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Just lose passing here, where I'm pumbling on top and things like that, and we look at it and passing in the first passing instructional, that's fine.

273
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But if you want to flank your partner, and I'm always going to look to do, as I'm going to look to put two feet on the same side of my partner's body.

274
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So instead of stepping into this position, and now trying to start my turn on the work from here, where my foot aligns with her center line.

275
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like so, I have to start tore down this from here. The second I step in, I kick a small step to the outside, so that my lead foot is on the outside of her hip on the side that I'm trying to pass to.

276
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So when I go to step in, this is very subtle, but it makes a huge difference when you're passing.

277
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:45,000
When I go to engage my partner, instead of stepping into this position, and doing my work from here, I step in like so.

278
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So now, my two feet are outside my partner's hip, and instead of having my foot in the center line, my foot is outside my partner's hip one, like so.

279
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What this does is it makes it incredibly hard for your partner to put legs on you, to attach to her legs to you.

280
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If I go in here, my partner, I can only hold my partner's legs for so long. I don't have the luxury of having grip to my partner's knee pants like I would if there was a jacket.

281
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
For now, when she gets to reach towards me, I can start pushing the legs, and I can hold her legs for a long amount of time.

282
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I can only like control my partner's legs for so long, so she clears my grips which she eventually will, and I get this before I make a step, she's engaging my legs.

283
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Whereas here, when I outflank my partner, and I move to a side, even if she clears my hands, it's still really hard for her, she has to change an angle first before she can really engage my leg again, okay?

284
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So this gives you the extra time that you need to start a tutorial on those secrets.

285
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So when I engage in some fine guard, I come behind my hands, I go relatively mid-shin, as I walk in, assuming I'm looking to flank my partner, I walk in like so.

286
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I catch, I take a step out, and I shuffle, one, two, one, two.

287
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I get to an angle, okay? This is so much more effective than starting everything from here, just a small angle change.

288
00:35:46,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I'm going to make a huge difference for us, and we'll see why in a second, okay? So we can behind the hands, and we move to a flight with a lead leg outside our partner's hips, two feet on the same side of the body, rather than one foot aligned at the center line.

289
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:20,000
All right, I know we went over this, and the past, but it's super boring because everything we're doing today is based around Toriando, so assuming you didn't watch the first instructional or you need or vision on it, we'll go over Toriando footwork, okay?

290
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:35,000
When you're looking to hit Toriando without the geek, understand that you don't have the luxury of robust grips on your partner's legs through the pants, so you can kind of cheat with your footwork when you're working in a geek,

291
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:44,000
because you have control of your partner's legs for long amounts of time. When you have grips in your partner's legs, without the geek, they're just grips that are used for touching go methods.

292
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:58,000
While I just touch, I throw, and then the hands usually come off as my partner highlights, and I have to re-grepp and throw it to the other side. So what actually gets you pass your partner's guard is the precision of footwork when you move side to side.

293
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So your footwork is actually doing to work, not your hands. The hands are just a supplement to throw the legs and the opposite direction to get your partner's feet and knees pointing away from you, which is one of our goals from the original passing instructional.

294
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So as your partner's feet come towards you, you throw them further than they wanted to go, and then you step across the other side. So the precision of footwork is what gets you pass your partner's hip one.

295
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,000
When I'm looking to pass my partner, okay, we're just going to do this with no hands, first of all, just so I can have the footwork and then we're going to add the hands and later.

296
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But I'm looking to step with the toy on those. I'm looking to step, pass my partner's hip line every time.

297
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I have to step past that jeopardy point where my partner's in jeopardy having a guard pass. Otherwise there's no pressure. If I toy on them and I go here, there's no pressure, I toy on them and I go, it is no pressure.

298
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But if I just take a small step and I go past my partner's hip one, now when she goes, now when she goes to react, it's a big reaction and she has the high leg over, she has a face meat, she can move her whole body in order to not get her guard pass.

299
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So our basic tour down the footwork is going to be from a situation originally initially outflank our partner. Now we're going to take a small step outside with our left foot.

300
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And depending on where you start your tour down the front, this will be a bigger or smaller step. If I start with my foot, splitting my partner's center line, this definitely will be a little bit bigger.

301
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
If I start with my feet out of this position, it'll just be a very small step to the outside.

302
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay, and then I'm going to take a cross step past my partner's hip one. Again, depending on where you start, this will be a bigger or smaller step.

303
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If I start here, it'll be a big step past.

304
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,000
But if I run to an angle, I take a small step and then the cross step is basically just straight to my partner's hip.

305
00:38:46,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So instead of stepping across like so, I just step straight up here. And now from here, I make a pivoting motion so that my knee points toward my partner's forehead.

306
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And I step to my partner's J point to hip lines. And from here, my knee points toward my partner's forehead chest, your partner, a big partner will always bring a leg up, throw a leg over and enter into your legs, and now you're getting beaten this position.

307
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Now you're going to pass 50/50, your partner has cross-harmic and thanks to the fall part.

308
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So I always step like so, and now I pivot. So that my knee instead of pointing towards my partner's forehead shoulder, point towards my partner's forehead.

309
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Because of my leg position now, this will just inherently make it harder for my partner to enter into my legs again.

310
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And I'll make it harder for her to enter into my legs. I'm possible, but harder.

311
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The main reason why I do this is so that I have readily accessible V-drips to my partner's legs. So when she goes to leg lock, may you bring her legs up into an Aussie growing, I can actually access my partner's legs.

312
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Whereas here, I know access to my partner's legs until they're actually in tangling.

313
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So just when I go to the step to the side, we come in, I start from this position. If I start right in front of my partner, we take a big outside step.

314
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If I start flanking my partner, we take a small outside step, and then we just step right to our partner's hip. Like so. Now we take a pivot where we take this foot comes around, it was above my partner's shoulder line.

315
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And now we'll well pass our corners J point, we have access to the legs, and now my partner will have to bring an easy and order to knock in our guard pass. Okay, stepping to one side. So we can step to one side, very easily. Like so, if we're going to the other side.

316
00:40:48,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So the same thing, or if I start an originally with a flank, small step, straight step, and then we pivot. Now you saw it to get used to this and you start going side to side. So I go in, I originally initially step and we're here.

317
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Now as my partner's knees are coming in to regard, I'm going to take a very small step back out past my partner's hip one.

318
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Here, I don't go here, so far away, or now I can't reach the other side. I don't go so close, or my legs hit together, I stumble on my own legs.

319
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I take a small step right out past my partner's hip one, like so, so that my foot points across my partner's hips and the same direction or hips are pointing.

320
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And now from here, I just lean my weight on to one foot, and as your knees come this way, I take across that across my partner's body.

321
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And I pivot. She goes to bring her knees in, take a small step, and I pivot. Knees in.

322
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Every time, you can get well beyond your partner's hip one, with this stepping pattern.

323
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Right, going to come in, initially, we're here, she brings the knees in, as she's bringing the knees in, I'm going.

324
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,000
So once we get the footwork pattern down, now we bring the hands into the equation.

325
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Hands come in, and I don't always ask me, "What group are you trying to make in your partner's legs?" And here at the moment, it doesn't matter what group you make.

326
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Your hands are for touching go method. There's a variety of groups that you can make, and you're not going to let set your grips as you want them every single time.

327
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It'll be here, sometimes it'll be here, sometimes it'll be here, sometimes it'll be here. It'll be here, but maybe a group you can use. The only thing you're looking for is some kind of connection to your partner's legs, so you can touch and go.

328
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So the second you go to bring your legs in, I just grab the legs, I touch, as she goes to bring the leg towards me, I throw them, and then I go. She goes to bring the legs in, I throw them, and I go.

329
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I throw them, and I go. I throw them, and I go. When every time I'm past it, it's a jade ball, and she has to give me a real reaction, otherwise using jeopardy, of getting a guard past it.

330
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This stepping pattern, and by the throwing of the legs, you can stay consistently, pass your partners, pass your partners hit one, on either side, going back and forth, and putting incredible amounts of passing pressure, side to side, as your partner goes to re-guard.

331
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And the whole time, there's no meaningful connection of her legs to yours.

332
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So now we're going to look at an idea of creating tension in my partner's legs. Now what is the advantage of this?

333
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:11,000
A little thought experiment. If I ask you, or if you ask me to pick up a sunny, to carry your 20 feet from this side of the room, which one would be easier.

334
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:19,000
One where she's standing up, and her entire body is flexed, or one where she's on the floor, dead weight, and I have to pick her up and carry her across the room.

335
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Obviously, it's much easier to move her when there's tension going through the body, because you can easily move the whole body around you know exactly.

336
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:35,000
If I put this much energy, the body's going to move this far, as opposed to just picking up a dead body and everything's all flopping around.

337
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,000
This is, this is true with guard passing. People all have those guys who are super flexible at their legs, and you try to move them, and they're just flopping around.

338
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:51,000
They're like gumbi, and you try to move their legs around, and they're so relaxed that it's hard to get any real reaction to that of them.

339
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And it's hard to move around, it's hard to spin their body, it's hard to move them around.

340
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Same thing with arm bars, if I'm looking to go into arm bars, as a defensive player, I want my armers relaxed as possible, so my partner has a hard time moving it around.

341
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:15,000
If someone's trying to extend my arm in an arm bar, and I'm flexed the whole time, and I'm trying as hard as I can, to not move my arm, it's easy for my partner to know who the arm is moving around.

342
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:23,000
If you pull it, you pull it, you pull it, you know exactly where it's going to go, but if it's relaxed, I can move it back and forth relatively easily as much harder for someone to control it.

343
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
That's the same thing with the legs when your guard passes.

344
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:36,000
If I can create tension in my partner's legs, it's going to be much easier to move my partner around, and to either outflank them or stuff the legs or move the legs where I want to.

345
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So just playing with this idea will make things much easier. If I go to move my partner's legs and they're relaxed, it's hard for me to pull around my partner.

346
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But if I go to move my partner's legs and she's tense, now I can move my partner exactly where I want to.

347
00:45:51,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I know exactly how far my partner's legs are going to move, whereas when they're relaxed, it's a hard thing, I move my partner and I don't get any real reaction with the rest of her body, her legs move independently of the rest of her body.

348
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,000
But when it's tension, now when I move the legs, the whole body moves.

349
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So our goal, as passers, is to create tension within my partner's legs.

350
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So that when I move the legs, I get a real reaction to the rest of the body.

351
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The question is, how can we create that tension? And the answer is, think it.

352
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:43,000
All right, let's look at some things, just basic things in front of my partner to get the great tension through the legs. Now you can faint in front of your partner when you're still engaged inside some form of guard.

353
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:51,000
When you haven't passed the J point yet, you can faint beyond the J point when you're passed the hip line and you can also faint in north south when you pass the shoulder line.

354
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So there's fainting in multiple stages of through paths. We don't have to just faint in front of someone. There's many times you have to create tension in the legs.

355
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Move, got to move people around much easier. Okay, but just basic fainting in front of a person.

356
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
There are three major kinds of faints that we can be looking at.

357
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
One is a throwing faint where I just throw my partner's legs side to side and throw one side to the other side and I just use that to create tension.

358
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The other is shuffling faints where I shuffle side to side and the third is switching faints where I switch my feet.

359
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And we can use these all in combination. I have to use one of the other. We use all in combination depending on my partner's reactions.

360
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So let's take a look at these.

361
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:40,000
A throwing thing is what I step in my inside my into my partner's legs and I can be either a front of my partner like so or we can walk to an angle.

362
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And now from here we can throw our partner's legs from side to side where we can faint in one direction like so. Now she creates tension and I throw the other way.

363
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So I can step in and I just go in.

364
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I just move my partner's legs around. I just give small fast twitch movements.

365
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And move my head offline. My head center. My head moves offline and one direction and the legs go in the opposite.

366
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
If I'm at an angle already, just bring legs towards me.

367
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:21,000
My head moves as my legs as my hands go on the other direction. That big movement is just.

368
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
This cool create tension in your partner's legs.

369
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Another way of fainting is shuffling where I physically just shuffle from side to side.

370
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
This can bind with a throwing.

371
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Will allow you to faint and start creating tension in your partner's legs.

372
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And I can go, you know, have to faint and shuffle the same distance every time.

373
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I can give a small shuffle and then a big shuffle.

374
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And then we go.

375
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So eventually, I'm shuffling, shuffling, shuffling, shuffling and now I step past my partner's legs.

376
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:33,000
We're past the legs. The third is a switching faint, okay, where I switch my legs as I faint.

377
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This once, a little bit tricky and can easily confuse a talented opponent.

378
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,000
When I step with my right leg forward, she knows subconsciously.

379
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And I'm looking to pass her right soft. Why is this?

380
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
If I step, my right leg forward.

381
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And I take a step to her left hip here.

382
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I expose my center line and she can dominate this space between my knees and throw a lot of noshy drummers.

383
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So if I go in and I step in this direction, I widen the space between my knees and I expose this space here.

384
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So now she clears the hands. She enters into my legs.

385
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
This is no good, okay.

386
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:34,000
So when I come in, she knows that if I try to pass her left and I'm right leg lead, this is a mistake on my part.

387
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And now she has all kinds of entrances into offense.

388
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So subconsciously, good player will know if I come in, high my hands.

389
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And I have a right leg lead, I'm passing to her right side because now when I cross that,

390
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I minimize the space between my two knees.

391
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Now she has to enter into my legs. She can't use any straight-hushy drumming entrances.

392
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And I can sort out like in my partner, okay.

393
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So if I'm rightly forward, she knows I'm passing right.

394
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:11,000
To use a switching thing, where if I want to pass to my partner's right, I step in left lead forward, like so.

395
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And now from here, I make a faint like I'm going to throw my partner's legs to her right and pass to her left.

396
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So I go to step with my left left and I go to faint and I throw like so.

397
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
My partner gives me a reaction and creates tension in the legs and a feet go to face me or her knees go to face me like so.

398
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The second I see that, I just quickly switch my feet.

399
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And as I switch, I pass in the up to direction.

400
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Now she has to face me.

401
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
We switch our feet, we use a switching thing to switch from one side to the other.

402
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So I create the illusion of passing left, I step in, left foot.

403
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Now as I go to throw, I go to step.

404
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
She thinks I'm passing left.

405
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But I passed right.

406
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So she thinks I'm passing left.

407
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
But I passed right.

408
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
She thinks I'm passing left.

409
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But I passed right.

410
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So I step in like so, I go to throw.

411
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And now I just have to my partner's hip line.

412
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
She knows I'm going to pass left.

413
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
As she goes to face me.

414
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
She adjusts for this.

415
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And now.

416
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I pass the opposite side.

417
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So switching faint combined with these strong things.

418
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So I go to step to one side and plant here.

419
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I'm playing lessly far.

420
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I come in.

421
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I come out throwing.

422
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I'm shuffling.

423
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And then I switch.

424
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So we can create tension with these three things.

425
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
A partner goes to react.

426
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And she's like, man, it's just as terrible.

427
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
She doesn't know where I'm going.

428
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And then we're passed at J point.

429
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
We create tension.

430
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
At least I'm getting past.

431
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
My partner said one on either side.

432
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So basic things in front of our partner.

433
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
We have throwing things.

434
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And we combine them with shuffling things and switching things.
