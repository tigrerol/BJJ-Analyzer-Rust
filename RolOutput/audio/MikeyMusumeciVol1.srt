1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay guys, so what we're going to cover in this first part of our series is control. Control is the most important part of guard.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There's control in someone and then there's attacking someone. Without control, it's very dangerous to attack because when you have no control, you're vulnerable to attacks from your partner.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's so important to understand how to control someone.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, I wanted to find control quickly for you guys before moving on.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I used a lot of terminology in GJ tip and I think it's very important that you understand these terms.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just to then be your understanding of guard will be complete.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, because I don't want to just give you a tax to do. I want to give you a full understanding of how to control your opponent.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How to attack your opponent. Everything about the guards, I need you guys to understand. Okay, so let's define control.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There's two parts of control that we're going to cover in this series. There's framing your opponent and then there's hooking your opponent.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Framing your opponent is when you make a distance from your opponent where they can't come into you.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you have no frames on your opponent, they can pass your guard, right? They're not. You have no frames.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to cover frames and hooking separate, but I just give you a quick.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I put over view of what we're going to be covering because each of these concepts, I'm going to explain how they apply to a knee shield like we're working.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, so a frame is distance management. We're keeping the distance from our partners.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hooking somebody is that opposite. We're actually keeping them from being able to back away from us, okay?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Both are essential in us playing guard because both are a part of our overall objective of control, right?

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And without control, it's very dangerous to attack our partner.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So the first part of this whole series is going to be learning how to control the person.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Because the first step of guard is control. The second step of guard is attacks. Once we have full control of our partner.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just wanted to give you guys a quick overview of this and now we're going to get into frames.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But again, there's two parts of control, frame and hooking, and we're going to cover each element of that now.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay guys, so now we're going to cover the first part of control.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Like I discussed previously, the first part of control in guard is for art frames. What is a frame? A frame is your distance management.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Your frame prevents your partner from putting all their weight onto you and smashing you, right?

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In guard frames are the most important thing.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wow, if I have no frames, my partner is enough, right?

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I have no frames on my partner. Look, she gives not. There's no frames. So when I play guard, all I'm thinking about an issue is how I could place my body on my partner to keep a wall from stopping her from passing my guard.

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, this is the most important thing because think about it.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The more frames I've heard on my partner, her her to pass my guard, she has to win each individual frame.

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If I have, if I have one frame on her, she removes it, she has to make her.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If I have two frames on her, now she has to remove one, just remove the second, and then she can pass my guard.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So my objective, what I'm playing guard, is to make as many things on her body as possible.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because once I make all these things on her body, they will eliminate, you will make it so much harder for her to pass.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Because she has to start individually eliminating each of my frames.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And the concept we're going to learn in this series and all of our, because

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
GG2 isn't just one specific thing. We're doing so many things from everywhere the same.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, there's so many general concepts. Okay, and what you're going to learn is how when they eliminate one of our frames,

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
all other frames are what's going to help us redeem that frame.

39
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, that's how we play guard always.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm going to get over, I'm going to go over soon how we're going to frame and be healed.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, but right now I'm discussing our objective with frames.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We're just placing our body on our partner to keep them from passing our guard.

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If we have no frames, they will pass their guard.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, so I want that to be your mindset when you're playing guard.

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm going to place as many parts of my body on my partner to make it way more difficult to pass the guard.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because when you're on top, all you want to do is remove everything from you to pass the closer distance.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, and now in the next video I'm going to cover are the most important parts of the body to frame.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, there's very specific spots that I'm focused on when I'm framing my partner.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, and also what I need you guys to understand is overall, the frames in place on our partner is our foot.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's the definition of four digits.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The four is the overall accumulation of frames.

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
For my foot to be strong, I need to have this strongness for this possible.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Strong frames have nothing to do with your strength and your body.

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This strong frames have to do with your body position.

55
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All I do is study body position because the angle of your hips, how you're holding the collar, how you're angleing yourself is all what makes your frames strong.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What happens is when you're playing guard, the second you have one week frame on your partner, your partner could expose it and take advantage of it and break your foot.

57
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Think of it as a fort and there's a week point in the fort, they finally point and they attack that part, collapsing your overall fort, even though other parts of it was strong.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, so my goal in guard is to completely eliminate any weak points in my fort, totally with my frames.

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So each individual frame I have to obsess about to make perfect.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I'm just giving up with all of you of our objectives.

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We're going to learn how to frame our opponent and I'm going to show you now the most important frames we're going to use in this series.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And in guard general.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So now we're going to cover our most important frames in guard for you to think of.

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, this is so important to understand because these specific parts of the body are what's going to stop your partner from being able to perceive over.

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If I place my foot in the other parts of the body, if I focus on other parts of the body, I wouldn't be framing the correct one.

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, but I want to show you is the most two important frames I'm going to be covering for you guys, there's a tip.

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's one on the hip bone, the interior severe, the spine, this frame is so important.

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, because every time she frames us, I cannot bring my body forward.

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If she was on my leg for example, let's say she's bring my leg, look how I can bring my hip forward.

70
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And look how he's our person. Whatever she's right on my hip bone, I can't come forward.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If she were both in my hip bones up, I cannot come forward.

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You say, so we're always thinking about how we can frame this hip bone, what we're playing with.

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because every time you go frame this hip bone, I cannot proceed forward.

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Meaning, look how I cannot bring my body forward.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If she was on my leg, if she was on my ribs up, look how I can come forward.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Look how I can come forward.

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Look how I can come forward, you say.

78
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So it's super important to understand that we're framing right on the hip bone.

79
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, that the first frame you're going to learn in controlling the guard.

80
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The second frame we're going to learn, which accomplishes the same exacting, used to armpit.

81
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, every time she frames my armpit naturally, every time she frames my armpit and pushes pressure here,

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I cannot proceed forward again.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, wait, I like to explain this to students, it's seen like X.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So she's in signal like X on me.

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Here, right?

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If she's controlling the correct leg, her foot is right on the anterior superior X on the knee bone, right?

87
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When I remove the hip bone, look how I can pass the guard.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because there's nothing stopping my hip bone coming forward.

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But watch, if I remove the hip bone here, the grip from my hip,

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and she places her arm in my armpit like so.

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now look at her arm.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Look how I can not bring my hip forward again.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can go this way.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But my hip does hip go forward.

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why?

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because the armpit.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay.

98
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So if I can't proceed forward, I'm going to have super efficient frames on my partner.

99
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay.

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And this is the way that if you're smaller than your partner,

101
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that you could control them without them coming forward.

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
When I find in Europeans about a year ago, I bought some important accounts.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And I placed my feet in his armpits when I played guard.

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And that stopped him from being able to get over my legs.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Because I made my legs perfect on his body.

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But if you couldn't come forward, so he stopped.

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's so important to understand, guys, honor it and hit.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Those are the two most important frames in guard that we're going to cover.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And now I'm going to show you how we're going to do this in the shield.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to give you guys each individual.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm going to have a lesson for each individual of part of the shield.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Just so you guys have all understanding how to control the partner.

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because in the shield, your body leg, your partner's over one of your legs.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it's super important to learn how to frame.

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You need to be able to frame the shield to play it.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's the most important part of the shield.

119
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So we're going to get into that now.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But again the tip on those are the two most important frames we're going to be covered with.

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, guys.

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So now we're going to cover is what we're going to be doing in this series.

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We're playing knee shield.

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
knee shield is a form of half guard.

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So there's open guard where my legs are outside my partner, right?

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I'm not open. There's closed guard where again my legs are outside my partner.

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And then there's knee shield.

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Where one of my legs is inside my partner's legs.

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay, there's many guards where you have one of your legs inside your legs.

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
knee shield is one of these guards.

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What is good about knee shield? What's bad about knee shield?

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The good thing about knee shield is I'm able to control my partner from getting away from it.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I haven't covered helps yet. I haven't covered the other part of this yet.

136
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
All we're talking about is frames.

137
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But because she's over one of my legs, I'm able to keep her from backing away from me.

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The cannabis is because I'm able to keep her from backing away from me, which I'm going to cover.

139
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
She could put more pressure on her.

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She could use more pressure to comfort.

141
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So how I frame her is going to be the most important part of knee shield.

142
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's way more crucial for me to be framing her correctly either.

143
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then if I was an open guard.

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If I was an open guard, she's not already over one of my legs.

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She doesn't have a connection over my leg.

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She has to put one of my legs down and then get the half of it.

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And now she can start putting pressure on me to pass my guard.

148
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right?

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So what I'm going to show you now is the first leg I used to frame my partner.

150
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is the most important part of knee shield.

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you get this down, you'll be able to clean knee shield perfect on everyone.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because no one will be able to crush you before.

153
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay?

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So what I'm going to do is, like I explained, there's two parts of the guard on the knee balcony.

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's the armpit and there's the hip over here.

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And these are the two types of knee shield, right?

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's a low knee shield like this and then there's the upper knee shield like this.

158
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay?

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In this series, I'm covering the upper knee shield.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I personally prefer to always play upper.

161
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I want to show her upper body at all times.

162
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay?

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't like when my partner puts weight on her knee here.

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There's some mission exposure.

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There's many different things I can do in this scenario.

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But how I play in a perfect world.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I always want to play like this is hooking her shoulder, play on her shoulder like so.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay?

169
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So like I said, the hip and the armpit are the two places we're going to be in the shield.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay?

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
For this first one, I'm going to show you how to play in the shield.

172
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So what?

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going to be here.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Again, we're not going to continue to my line yet.

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay?

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm going to be covering every single thing possible with this bottom, like also.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And this arm, and every other part of my body.

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But right now, all we're covering is this left leg, how I'm going to be using it for this year.

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay?

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So what are we going to do?

181
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm going to do something.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to show you how to set up a knee shield with my top leg.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
All I'm going to do is I'm going to take my left arm.

184
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So like I explained before, am I going to hit all of the armpits?

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Pretty much for it.

186
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm going to take my hand.

187
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm going to put my fist in the armpit like so.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Look how my gut goes, or right in the armpit.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So really show it for at least.

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You see how stops are from bringing the shoulder forward.

191
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Right?

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So now what am I going to do?

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to reinforce my frame on my partner punching away her shoulder.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Put my leg as well in the same spot.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So there's two ways that we're going to be legally able to place my foot or my leg.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What is going to do with my shin on our armpits and comfort?

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The second will be my toes.

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And the toes will have a purpose later on in the series.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Right?

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So for now, all we're going to be doing is to shin.

201
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And the shin is sufficient control.

202
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's perfect control.

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay?

204
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So basically what I'm doing is every time I'm here,

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I just need to keep my partner shoulder back.

206
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If my partner shoulder comes forward,

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
she could generate pressure on me.

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
She could put more pressure to pass my gut.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So all I want is to do is think about bringing this shoulder,

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
punching her shoulder away.

211
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And now all I'm going to do is take my shin and put her shoulder.

212
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What I want you to see is how when I look this shoulder come forward,

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
look how my shin stops her from coming forward.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So I'm sorry my fist, so punch come forward.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So I'm sorry my fist and look.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
When I'm framing her, notice how when I'm here,

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm also who my fist right on her collarbone.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why?

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because a collarbone is directly afraid.

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Every time you're trying to grab a collar,

221
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
anytime you're framing your partner,

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you're looking to go on a bone.

223
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The concept of bone for soft tissues,

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I talk about it every one of my DVDs,

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and basically when your soft tissue,

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
she can bury my shin because there's nothing framing her.

227
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When you're on the bone, she can not bury my shin.

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because she's directly a ball on her.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay.

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So always we're aiming for them,

231
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the bone on her arm, right?

232
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So like push your shoulder on top, right?

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Knuckle is on her shoulder.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Right on the collarbone, right?

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And not on her neck.

236
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now when you sit on a hook,

237
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
your shoulder is up.

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
When my shin, right on her body,

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm going to talk about my foot,

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
a little bit later in the hooking part of the series,

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
right now we're framing all I'm doing is placing my shin on her shoulder.

242
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And I'm raising my shin in a way that when you come forward and forward,

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
she can not bring her shoulder forward.

244
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If I didn't raise my shin this way,

245
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
look how my leg bears.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So look at my knees below my leg.

247
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
When the hoists are buried.

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But look how when I bring my knee up,

249
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
knuckle forward.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Look how she cannot come forward.

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So I'm my fist,

252
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and my shin,

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
the stop of the knee forward,

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
they show you come forward, they show you.

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You see how she cannot come forward, they show you the guys.

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So all the advanced things I'm going to show you,

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
all these crazy things I'm going to show you.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If you cannot do this,

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and you skip this second,

260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you will have trouble with everything.

261
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay, I'm telling you,

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
this is the most important part of the knee shell,

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
at everything I'm showing you,

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
is this hooking the shoulder relation

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
with my knee up and framing the shoulder.

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay, if this shoulder is forward,

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
look how my knee starts collapsing.

268
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Look how she starts putting pressure on me.

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Look how she gets her feet in things and passing my gun.

270
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But if I'm able to keep my fist on her shoulder,

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
like so, I put nothing thing.

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Look how she cannot come into me.

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's why I'm covering this how and this is the so important thing.

275
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Look it also be like this,

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
which will learn in other sections why I do this.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But basically the concept here is

278
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
you're replacing your hand with your leg.

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We're using our hand works,

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and we're reinforcing it with our other hand.

281
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I mean with our other leg.

282
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You see, both things are helping me,

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
keep her shoulder back.

284
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So this is the first lesson you're learning on framing.

286
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is our first frame initial,

287
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
our shin hooking the shoulder by so.

288
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Not hooking, just frame your shoulder.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We're not hooking yet.

290
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We're not using our hook on the shoulder.

292
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
All we're doing is putting our shin on shoulder.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay.

294
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm not always hooking her shoulder.

295
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm moving.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm typically with my shin like so.

297
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And hooking will be in another scenario,

298
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and I'm going to show you that briefly.

299
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay.

300
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So for now, we're here.

301
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
All you need to do is,

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
we're here helping her.

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And get to the knee show and push the shoulder by hook.

304
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then we stop here.

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
My fist on top of my knee.

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
My knuckles pushing.

307
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And my hand right on top of my leg.

308
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is all we're doing for now.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't worry about your hooks.

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't worry about anything.

312
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
All we're doing is framing.

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And again, the definition of framing.

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Keeping your partner from coming in.

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We're not keeping them from back in the way.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Just keeping them from coming in.

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All right.

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay, guys.

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So now what I want you guys to do is,

321
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I want you guys to practice this trip.

322
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm not using my bottom leg at all.

323
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The partner top is just going to be trying to pressure this shoulder into it.

324
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And you're just going to frame with your fist on the collar.

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because we've got the collar right.

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We're going to place our shin right on the shoulder.

327
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And they're going to try to be into it.

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
All you're going to do is just frame that shoulder.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And all that partner is doing is really natural.

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They're not doing anything else.

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is just going to teach you to be correct.

332
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Because if they're driving all the way forward and you're able to keep them from coming forward,

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
you're framing correctly.

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay.

335
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Like I explained before, this is so important.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This particular way I'm grabbing for shoulder.

337
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm framing for shoulder.

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So I need you guys to get this down.

339
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

340
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I'm here.

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm not going to tear my bottom leg.

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Just leave it in the air when floating here.

343
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It doesn't matter what you're doing.

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If I'm like don't worry about the person passing,

345
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
all they're allowed to do is bring your shoulder forward.

346
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Here.

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Bring your shoulder forward.

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, you say.

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So I have to stop it from doing that.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
All I do is I keep my hand.

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I go my thumb inside with four fingers right on the collar.

352
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm punching it shoulder away.

353
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I put my shin right on top.

354
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Raising my lap with me.

355
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay.

356
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You're going to ask your partner to come into you.

357
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Okay.

358
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And what you're eventually going to be doing is letting go of this grip.

359
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And your leg is going to be doing it.

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But for now, we're just doing this.

361
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So come into it.

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Okay.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
At the end of the show again.

364
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So come into it.

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But how my shin is looking here?

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm punching her away.

367
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And now she can come into it.

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Right?

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So you're trying to drop her shoulder off.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If I remove my leg and my fist.

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Look how she falls for you.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So now.

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
See.

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And on my side, on my right hand.

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Right?

376
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
On my side.

377
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm just playing here.

378
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And look how this is protecting me.

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Look how my right hand is going to be free.

380
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Look how I left hand.

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And let you be free.

382
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's going to be so many things.

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But if you cannot do this.

384
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
These shows going to be very dangerous because they.

385
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're not going to be able to keep the distance, right?

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So our first frame is always here.

387
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Right?

388
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
On the right.

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay.

390
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Punching.

391
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay.

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Okay.

393
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

394
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is the first you'll initial that.

395
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What you guys practice.

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You know what the show is a while, but I just need you guys to have this understanding.

397
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Your party.

398
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Try as far as they can.

399
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The dry that shoulder.

400
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're just framing the shoulder.

401
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Okay.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This is going to teach you the perfectly.

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Use your.

404
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Neatial on their shoulder.

405
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

406
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So that's working.

407
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So now we're going to discuss the second part control.

408
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Obviously I have not discussed anything with my legs.

409
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm only focusing right on her upper body.

410
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Which is the first part controlling someone.

411
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Right?

412
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So we discussed framing our partner.

413
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Now we're going to discuss something else.

414
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're going to discuss what is a hook.

415
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
A hook is whenever I stop my opponent from being able to back away.

416
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So all I can is so far was when they try to come into you, putting pressure into your body.

417
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're able to frame them from coming into you.

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Now we're going to learn is how to keep them from burning away.

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay, because this is the second part of control.

420
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You have to frame and keep them from getting away.

421
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You have to control your partner's stuff.

422
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They can't back away and they can't come in.

423
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Right?

424
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So this is super important to understand.

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And how I like to explain a hook is with a grip actually.

426
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Why?

427
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Because look how similar a hook of grip is with control.

428
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So my partner comes into me like so.

429
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Here and she's trying to put it to me, but no I'm pushing her away with my fist.

430
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm framing her right so she can't throw into me.

431
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But the second she starts back in the way.

432
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Look, I want you guys to see something.

433
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
See how my finger.

434
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If my finger is in this line and she backs away, she is able to move her body back.

435
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why?

436
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because I'm not going to be behind her to keep her in.

437
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So watch what happens when I go to the collar.

438
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And I mean my four fears behind this collar now that way.

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Look how I have volume behind her to keep her from backing away.

440
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Again, right?

441
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No volume.

442
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They keep her back away with pressure falls away.

443
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Look how she's able to back away.

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Do you see that?

445
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So every time we're poking someone, again, with the other body, let's say I'm pushing her away.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Back away?

447
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now off.

448
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Back up.

449
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Look how I back around her mouth.

450
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Now she can't back away.

451
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This is the definition of a book.

452
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
A book keeps the partner from being able to back away.

453
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay?

454
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This is so important for us because what happens is when your partner tries to drive into it.

455
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
They feel the frame.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
In their mind, if they're not trying to force through a frame, they're going to think, okay, instead of driving through the frame,

457
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm going back away and then come back in.

458
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
To try to change it and go the frame.

459
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Changing angles is one of the biggest things in you, right?

460
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So while I'm here, and I push her away, so go the frame.

461
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And she backs right now.

462
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Now I'm going to try to frame this early and bring your shoulders back in.

463
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But that should feel like frame.

464
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Right?

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So I lost my next finger when she backs away.

466
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But now when she backs away, that way.

467
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Look how I want to do like work fingers behind the collar.

468
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
She can no longer back away.

469
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Because I have volume behind the collar.

470
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I have volume behind her back back left.

471
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
If I want that volume behind her back left, that is what a hook is guys.

472
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That is all a hook is intuitive.

473
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's just having volume behind the thing that you're trying to back away.

474
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And it keeps them from being able to back left.

475
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay?

476
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The biggest thing I need to understand is why this is important for us to understand

477
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and bring you before understanding and cooking.

478
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If I want to teach her from back to the leg.

479
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But I am real crazy.

480
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm going to keep her from back your legs and back left with it.

481
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Back left?

482
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Not gonna take it.

483
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Look how I can't stop her.

484
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm going there now.

485
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If I just hook her.

486
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You see the difference.

487
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I need to be able to frame her and come inside and back you away at the same time.

488
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
At the monitor or bull.

489
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That is the definition of control.

490
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Framing and cooking at the same time for full control of her partner.

491
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Right?

492
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So that is what I need to be guys to understand right now.

493
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We're stopping her from backing away and we're stopping her from killing him.

494
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Creating this middle ground where she's stuck.

495
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Okay?

496
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
This is why we got a full control of her partner.

497
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Okay?

498
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So now we're going to go on to the next part of the series.

499
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Which I want to show you now how I use my hook on her upper body.

500
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Then we're going to get into the lower body.

501
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But right now I want to just have.

502
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I want you guys to have perfect understanding how I'm using my upper body control on her.

503
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's what we need.

504
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The biggest difference in the start.

505
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
So now we're going to show you how we're going to use our top like any shield now

506
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
to monitor our partner from backing away.

507
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay?

508
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So I'm going to hear.

509
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And let's see if there's learned how I use my hand to have button behind my partner.

510
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So they can't back away.

511
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Now you're going to learn how to use your foot to do the same thing.

512
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay?

513
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But first I want you to see something to come into me.

514
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm afraid of her.

515
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But they feel the frame.

516
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They want to back up now.

517
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Back up.

518
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Now come into me what you're shoulder down.

519
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You see?

520
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is very important.

521
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I understand this.

522
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So when she comes into me it frames.

523
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I beat the collar.

524
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And my four fingers are going to drop around her collar.

525
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So I have to follow you behind the grip.

526
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Now to back away from the collar.

527
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Look how many would it super backing away from just my hand.

528
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Right?

529
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But again, I'm using my light here.

530
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Why would I use my light the most in patient work?

531
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So I'm going to take my toes now.

532
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
And I'm going to wrap it behind your back.

533
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So it's super close.

534
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Look how when I got my toes behind her back.

535
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You hang her back back with it.

536
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
She cannot back away.

537
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So I have like four fingers in her collar.

538
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Putting the body behind them.

539
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Look how many four fingers in her collar.

540
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Pretty body behind them.

541
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm just showing you a box.

542
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And you say.

543
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And my toes wrapping her arm.

544
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Now she can't back away.

545
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So now it's the back of that.

546
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,000
So this is how we're hooking our partner with upper body.

547
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We're free.

548
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So come in to me.

549
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Now start the back away.

550
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
My foot is there tomorrow from back away.

551
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And my knuckle here.

552
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Pulling her in.

553
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Look how she can't back to the shoulder.

554
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Look how she's stuck.

555
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Look how she comes forward.

556
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
She's free.

557
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Look how she backs away.

558
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
She's free.

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now I would define this as control.

560
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Right?

561
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Because I have a book elements of distance management.

562
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And her backing away.

563
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So I have the hooking.

564
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I have the framing at the same time.

565
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So this is what both control is.

566
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Okay.

567
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So now this is what we covered in this one.

568
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Now I'm going to quickly give you a draw.

569
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Just the boxes poking at shoulder.

570
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And then we're going to start getting into the body like.

571
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Okay.

572
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Like I said, we're breaking this down.

573
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Each part of the body is specific.

574
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Because I want you to have perfect body position for each part.

575
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
If I quickly did this, skimming it without explaining this, you would not have perfect body position.

576
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay. So I want you guys to really practice these individual parts of me show.

577
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay.

578
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So before we drill framing our partner from them coming into us, right?

579
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Now we just learn the hooking.

580
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Let's keep them from backing away.

581
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So now we're going to combine the two together.

582
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We're going to drill them.

583
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Come in and tell us.

584
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And then back and go.

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay.

586
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So watch what you're doing.

587
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The jokes are going to be like this.

588
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Again.

589
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I won't care about how I'm using my bottom right now.

590
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay.

591
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm going to be explaining everything about the bottom.

592
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Right now we just focus on this shoulder,

593
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
which is the most important part of our control in the initial initial.

594
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Okay.

595
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So all that's going to happen is you're going to come into me.

596
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm going to frame your shoulder.

597
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Again, if I have no four fingers behind the volume of her collar,

598
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
if I don't have any hooking on her back, back with me,

599
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
look how she could back her shoulder with me.

600
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Okay.

601
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So all I have to do now is, which is framing commitment,

602
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
all I'm going to do is I'm framing.

603
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
As I feel she's back in the way,

604
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm going to place my four fingers behind the collar.

605
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Like so.

606
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So now I'm going to be behind her collar.

607
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm going to place my toes on her back.

608
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Now back with.

609
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Look how she cannot back away.

610
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Now coming to me.

611
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Look how when she started coming into me, I'd frame again.

612
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Now that way.

613
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Now come to me.

614
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Now that way.

615
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Now come to me.

616
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So that's all this deal is going to be on here.

617
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
She comes into me.

618
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Wow.

619
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Come into pressure pressure.

620
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's hard again.

621
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Now that way as hard as you can.

622
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Look how she can.

623
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm able to have a full control over now.

624
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
This drill will guarantee that you're playing the knee shield correctly with the control.

625
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay.

626
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So I need you guys to just drill this a little bit, practice it.

627
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The person coming in, the person back me up.

628
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Don't have any change angles.

629
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Don't have the move at all.

630
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Because right now, all we're doing is focusing on the upper body.

631
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
This up.

632
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Every part of the body, I'm going to give you guys the perfect body.

633
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This is the perfect body position for it.

634
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So right now, we just learn how to have a whole complete control of this shoulder, right?

635
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Every time they back away, we put.

636
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
For we get volume behind them so they cannot back away.

637
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Every time they come into us and frame our frames, hit or armpit.

638
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Like always.

639
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And right now we're armpit.

640
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay.

641
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So we're just going to continue from here.

642
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But I just wanted you guys to do this.

643
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You'll quickly make sure you understand how to frame her.

644
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
[Music]

645
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
So now we're ready to discuss hooks in each shoulder with our legs.

646
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Okay.

647
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So we have discussed already how to control the upper body, controlling the shoulder, right?

648
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Because the armpit is one of the most important frames for us on the bottom.

649
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And also hook it, right?

650
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
So now we're going to learn is how we use our initial hook as a frame as well as a hook, right?

651
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And I also want to explain to you all the different length positions we're going to cover in this series.

652
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And how they're all basically the same, just altering the angle of our toes.

653
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Okay.

654
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So first thing I'm going to show you is the inside.

655
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So I already show you, right?

656
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
We've done this shoulder here.

657
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm ready to help her body.

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And I have my hook on her shoulder like so.

659
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
So now she comes in to me.

660
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
She can't.

661
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
She backs away.

662
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But now I'm going to show you my bottom like it's going to go inside.

663
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But all I need you guys to understand about when I go inside this game size, that's what you can see.

664
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
All I want you guys to see what I'm doing is I put my heel in the middle of the lower and upper part of her leg.

665
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So I want to show you guys what is it under her.

666
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And the other hook is whatever my hand is in the lower and upper part of her leg.

667
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
She has two parts of her leg, right?

668
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Why it under is so effective is because it controlled both parts of her leg.

669
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So when I'm here at least you know all I'm doing first is putting my heel in the middle of her lower and upper part of her leg.

670
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So now I want to explain to you this.

672
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The difference between each shoulder and the personality but because of my partners on her knees,

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
where we're doing is notice my heel remains the same.

674
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm going at least my toes on the lower part of her leg.

675
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Like I just explained this to you parts of her leg.

676
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Whatever my partner is on your knees, I'm controlling the lower part of her leg.

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Whatever my partner goes on with me, look what I did.

678
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
My heel remains identical, right?

679
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But now I'm no longer hooking the bottom part of her leg.

680
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm going at least my foot on the top part of her leg in reverse valley above, right?

681
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So go down here.

682
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Look at my heel remains the same on pole.

683
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So in knees you're on hooking the lower part of her leg, which we're covering this series.

684
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
When she brings her leg up, look now I put my foot on the upper part of her leg.

685
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because her leg is off the floor.

686
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The lower part of her leg, the upper part of her leg is off the floor.

687
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You see, when the lower part of her leg is on the floor, we hook the knee show with my foot.

688
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
When she takes it off, we're in reverse valley.

689
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So this is the first thing I want you to understand.

690
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Now I also want you to understand.

691
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The other part of the series, we're actually going to be doing this.

692
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Not only will I be initial, I'll have a butterfly leg like so.

693
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And I'll have a reverse butterfly hook like so.

694
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Again, following the same concept, look.

695
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The heel remains identical in pole, right?

696
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because this, the reverse butterfly hook, I'm hooking the lower part of her leg.

697
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The butterfly hook, I'm hooking the upper part of her leg.

698
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Look now my heel remains in the same place for pole.

699
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So I'm here in each show, which we're going to be doing this whole series.

700
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I've never been shown on her.

701
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I've got a leg collar, I bring my foot in.

702
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I'm just focused right now.

703
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm putting my heel in between the low and upper part of her leg.

704
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Like this.

705
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Now I realize, okay, she's on her knees.

706
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What does that mean?

707
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That means I'm grabbing the lower part of her leg on my toes.

708
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
You see how I'm grabbing the lower part of her leg on my toes?

709
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Now what this is going to make me do today.

710
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Because I'm grabbing her leg.

711
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So if I wasn't grabbing her leg out of here, just run her feet around and walk around me.

712
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Look how she's able to walk her legs.

713
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
How do you do the fine control before?

714
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
We define control by stopping her from coming into me and backing away.

715
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
If I'm only here, she could start backing away.

716
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Really, it's back as well.

717
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
You see? Because she's able to back away.

718
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Watch when I put something behind her.

719
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I put my toes behind her.

720
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Now that way.

721
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I do something in here.

722
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm backing away.

723
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Come into me.

724
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Now I'm making this wall under children.

725
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So as you guys can see, I have a bulk control of her leg.

726
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And when I grab my toes around the lower part of her leg,

727
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
it stops from being able to run away from me or continue as well.

728
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So I wanted to give you guys a understanding of why we're hooking the knees.

729
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The knees should come on the lower part of her leg. She's honored. That's why we're doing this.

730
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
If her knee comes up, we're a reverse belly man.

731
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

732
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Also, we're going to be covering this series by accident.

733
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The butterfly hook will be involved in the knee shield system.

734
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And the reverse butterfly hook.

735
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And what do they have identically in comment with the reverse?

736
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Not like the hook and the knee shield.

737
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
My heel remains the same in bulk.

738
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Just controlling the lower and upper parts of the leg are different.

739
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That's the only thing guys.

740
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So I wanted you guys just to get an understanding of both of these things.

741
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Do you see how I'm backing my leg around her?

742
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
All I'm doing is I'm here.

743
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm getting her shoulder.

744
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I just put my toes in.

745
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Right here, she's honored.

746
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I just brought my toes right over the leg like so.

747
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Okay.

748
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
This is all we're doing for now.

749
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay.

750
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I just wanted to give you an understanding of the hooks.

751
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's so important.

752
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes.

753
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So now I'm going to give you a quick drill

754
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
to practice hooking our partner.

755
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I wanted to see how completely controlling our partner now.

756
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And now we already have two parts of our body controlling the partner.

757
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Technically three.

758
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But my left head is going to be leaning at shoulders soon.

759
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So right now we're going to be having two parts of our body completely dominating her.

760
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Right.

761
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
As I explained previously, this whole series I'm going to show you how to have perfect control

762
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
with every part of our body or two legs and our two arms.

763
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Right.

764
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So watch how I'm going to control.

765
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
The Jo is going to be a solos.

766
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm here.

767
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm going to just like the previous job where I'm putting your shoulder.

768
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So come in to me.

769
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm punching her shoulder.

770
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I put, notice I'm on my right head.

771
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Right.

772
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm not square.

773
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm on my right head.

774
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm punching her shoulder right now.

775
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Come in to me.

776
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And now I'm putting my foot, my leg.

777
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You hurt her shoulder as well.

778
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So she's trying to come in to me.

779
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
She can't.

780
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
She tries to back away.

781
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I make body with my core fingers behind the collar.

782
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I hook her back.

783
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And I'm back.

784
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
She can't back away.

785
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So now I'm going to add this to this.

786
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
This bottom leg is going to go inside her leg.

787
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And now it's going to happen.

788
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's going to go in between the lower and upper part of her leg.

789
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But I want you to just focus on your heel.

790
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Get it inside.

791
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Not your toes.

792
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So you're going to go like this.

793
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm going up and shoulder her legs up.

794
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm going to go inside my leg.

795
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You'll meet you in the lower legs.

796
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Now all I'm going to do is place my heel right here.

797
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And between her legs.

798
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Like so.

799
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Now that my heel is inside the lower and upper part of her leg.

800
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'm going to just place my toes to the lower part of the leg.

801
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Okay.

802
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Now you can go on one knee.

803
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Please.

804
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So you sound like heels already in the spot.

805
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Now it would just go on top of the leg like so.

806
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You say you sound like down.

807
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Lower her leg.

808
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You see how it doesn't change either direction.

809
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Okay.

810
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
For this, you know, obviously we're initial.

811
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So her knee is down.

812
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm just cooking.

813
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But all I want you to bring to think about when you initially get to the knee.

814
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
She'll put in the heel right in between the lower and upper part of the leg.

815
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It is identical to under.

816
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Right.

817
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because what is under her family.

818
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And under her family is my hand in between the lower and upper part of her leg.

819
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So now I'm just using my leg to under her leg.

820
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Right.

821
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Now once I'm here, I put my toes right behind her lower part of her leg.

822
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm framing up with me.

823
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Now that's what?

824
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Now I'm cooking her leg.

825
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Okay.

826
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
This is all I want you guys to work now.

827
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
This now already.

828
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
We already established two parts of full control on my partner.

829
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Which already is going to give you an amazing success in knee shield.

830
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Right.

831
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
But now once we start adding in the other elements,

832
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
you're going to see how much better you're taxiing in get.

833
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Because remember what we said.

834
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
To attack her partner, we need full control.

835
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Guard your two things.

836
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Control it and attack you.

837
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
To attack knee control.

838
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Once we have full control, our attacks become easy.

839
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You're easier.

840
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Right.

841
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So this is the next row.

842
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Just putting her leg in.

843
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay.

844
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So this is the next row.

845
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Just putting her leg in.

846
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay.

847
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So this is the next row.

848
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Just putting her leg in.

849
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Okay.

850
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So this is the next row.

851
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Just putting her leg in.

852
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Okay.

853
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So this is the next row.

854
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Just putting her leg in.

855
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay.

856
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So this is the next row.

857
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Just putting her leg in.

858
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Okay.

859
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So this is the next row.

860
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Just putting her leg in.

861
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay.

862
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So this is the next row.

863
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So this is the next row.

864
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Just putting her leg in.

865
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay.

866
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So this is the next row.

867
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So this is the next row.

868
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So this is the next row.

869
00:38:40,000 --> 00:39:09,840
free mark on her shoulder, we're ready to begin learning where what I'm going to do next. What I'm going to discuss next is how I play on the cross cup. Okay. Like I explained our goal is to establish as many frames as I can on my partner. What I also explained is whenever I'm on a bone, I have way better frame than being on soft tissue. Okay. Now when I'm going to explain is how when I'm able to have full control on one part of my partner's body,

870
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:23,840
using two things, I can let go of one of those things once I pull control and use that thing now in another place. Okay. In other DVDs, I say I'm now free for actually our activities with this thing.

871
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:37,840
So how I describe it in my other DVDs, I describe it as you're using, you replace your whatever you're using and then what you replace it with another part of your body, it opens you up to use that in another part of your body.

872
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Because our goal is to do is full body efficiency, right? I want to be able to use my body as efficient as possible to the highest percent. Okay. So what I just showed you guys before.

873
00:39:49,840 --> 00:40:01,840
I mean this position, now I'm looking here for, right? Because we just learned this, my this and hand, my leg and knuckles are framing her so she can't come in and she can't back away because I'm looking.

874
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:11,840
I feel I have enough control of her shoulder, I'm able to let go of my hand now. Why? Because come into me, back away. Now back where you're like, you see.

875
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:19,840
So I'm now able to control her because of this bottom hook because of this I do things hooking her and I do things framing her at once.

876
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:31,840
So now this hand is free. This hand is free for our activities, okay? So in this series what we're going to learn about this hand.

877
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:39,840
Mostly in the series we're going to learn the color. We will be grabbing the cross lead at frames, but for now all we're going to be doing is grabbing the color.

878
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:51,840
So if we're following my rules before, how to frame my partner, where is my hand going to be? It's going to be directly on the color bone on the bone, right? So not completely.

879
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Look, I'm taking away another thing, come to me, now come to me, okay? So now I'm directly on the color bone, but I was on the soft tissue of come to me, look how my wrist starts collapsing because there's no frame on her, now come to me.

880
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:13,840
So now let me ask you, can you feel like there's a wall on you right now because of this frame, like from you coming in and then this thing, so three most other.

881
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:24,840
Yes, there's nothing she cannot come in, right? So now, as you see, we are already established somewhat control of my partner, right?

882
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:38,840
And also what I want you to see is right now the function of the cross color is just primarily on the frame, right? What we're going to learn to do with the cross color, like I explained other series, is spine and affiliation.

883
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Using my doubles on her neck, we're going to be learning to bring her neck down, possible submission exposure, right? There's many different things, framing her away, so come to me, okay?

884
00:41:52,840 --> 00:42:08,840
Pushing her this way, that is what's amazing on the color. Let me Mr. Rector had an interaction, and every time we put the Mr. Rector's spine in the direction of her body, it alters her face between each leg, which are going to be discussing balance in a little bit.

885
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:18,840
Right now, I'm here, framing her shoulder, we're just going to add in. What's like, "Well control, and we're this grip, and I grab the cross color, great on her color, it's amazing."

886
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:30,840
You see, I'm poking her bottom like, and I'm just in this spot. Whenever you're honking the bottom like, in your frame, you're not thinking about looking, all you're thinking about is your heel being in between the lower upper part of the leg.

887
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:42,840
Then your heel will go every time, okay? So, okay, please. Permission me? I'm poking, I'm framing. Once I feel my frame is sufficient, I push her back enough, I twist and I can grab down the frame again.

888
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Okay. Now, let me do it. And now, my frame is all that's left, right? So now we're going to be learning what to do with the right here.

889
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:02,840
But as you see, this is pretty much what we should. This right hand is going to be in many different places when I think you should.

890
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Okay, so there's not going to be one set rule for this. But for my guard, in general, this is my guard.

891
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,840
I already have these many things left. One, two, my hook is another thing. Three.

892
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:19,840
If I need to do my knee, which I'm only going to explain a little bit, I need to be on the outside of her body, will be your frame as well.

893
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:32,840
But you see, guys, for her and past my guard now, it's going to be very difficult because she's going to have to remove my frames to pass my guard, but she's going to have a really hard time because I've so much control of her from backing away and coming in.

894
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:38,840
So for her to remove my frames, it's going to be really difficult, guys. Okay. So now you're going to understand.

895
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Color group, we've got a right on the collarbone. Okay. That's what we're thinking about for now.

896
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Okay. We're hugging a leg, pretty darned. It's just like before. We're just replacing our knuckles that we're here to the cost collar.

897
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Now we need to go.

898
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:04,840
So now we just discussed our hugging the leg getting the collar. Now we're ready to discuss how we're going to play knee show.

899
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,840
Okay. So there's two worlds of knee show. Why do I keep everything in the world?

900
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,840
If you're not familiar with my diabetes, every thing I teach, I always convince the two worlds.

901
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:22,840
But because every time I do things into two worlds, it's either or independent on the scenario, I'll attack according to them.

902
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:30,840
So in my mind, I make everything into two worlds. Once I know I'm in a certain world, I know all the steps and procedures I have to follow in that world.

903
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,840
But then when they defend and give me the other world, I have my steps and procedures also to follow.

904
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,840
So I always try to make this split between both worlds.

905
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Okay. And when you're going to notice this is when I'm playing knee show, there's two worlds always.

906
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
But I'm here in knee show.

907
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:53,840
And I'm initially starting here with my hip. My hip on the shoulder and the collar. There's what the first world is my head is more towards her shoulder.

908
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,840
Right? And this arm is more forward. And this arm is more back.

909
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,840
The second world is when I'm over here in knee show. My head is not facing her shoulder.

910
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:11,840
And now I'll notice how this shoulder is more back. Both worlds will give me different opportunities to do things, right?

911
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,840
Just so you understand, there's going to be many attacks on both worlds.

912
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:21,840
Okay. And we're going to learn that every time we're doing one world, the partner might defend giving us the other.

913
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,840
So it's going to be very important for me to understand which, what to do in the scenario, right?

914
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,840
Because my start going through this shoulder, she might back, it's like, "I'm going to show the fat. Now look around. I'm in this world now."

915
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Okay? Or, "I'm here." In this world, she brings back shoulder to me. Now in this world. Okay?

916
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:46,840
So what is this going to come down to? This is all going to come down to a million hip interactions.

917
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:54,840
In the first world, the series we're covering the far side, the far side. Okay? This is the same side, and this is the far side.

918
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:02,840
In this part of the series we're covering all far side stuff. Okay? So this two world, far side, same side we're covering far side, and first.

919
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,840
So my objective to this series is always going to be getting my head to her shoulder, that far shoulder.

920
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,840
Once I get my head to that shoulder, we're going to see how many opportunities present themselves.

921
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Okay? But also what I want you to know this, since we already learned about the hooking, notice where my knee is right now.

922
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,840
When I'm in the same side of the knee, she'll, right? Look how my knee is outside her body, it's a frame.

923
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,840
Notice when I go to that far side of the knee, she'll look how my knee starts moving inside her leg.

924
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,840
And notice also how my toes that are in the knee show start are not as deep, so go to this one.

925
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,840
So when I'm first in the knee, the same side, right? Here, look how my toes are deep and my knee is not in.

926
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,840
When I start walking, look how my toe gets deeper in, and now my knee is inside.

927
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Now it's like I'm playing a butterfly hook on this leg at the same time as playing with the knee show hook.

928
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:02,840
You say, so when I'm on the far side, my knee starts going in like a butterfly hook.

929
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,840
You say, and that's going to be a new way of me controlling her, whatever I get to this far side.

930
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Okay? And when I'm here, my knee is shallow, so my foot is still in really tight.

931
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,840
As I walk, if you'll get deeper and my knee starts going in, as if I had a butterfly hook.

932
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:30,840
You see, I'm her butt right here. But now I have two hooks. One on the inside of this leg, and the other on this leg, which is going to help us tremendously in later parts of this series.

933
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Okay? So right now we're working the far side series in the show, right?

934
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:41,840
And I just wanted to make you understand how when I angle myself, my knee starts going inside her legs.

935
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,840
That's going to be tremendous for us in later parts of this series.

936
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,840
And again, keep in mind when we're playing this, we're also going to have attacks eventually on that same time.

937
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Okay? So I want you to just have this understanding about to explain to you what pros I'm going to have,

938
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:03,840
also being on this side with how I'm able to grab the collar and use my knee as well with the collar.

939
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:11,840
Okay? So I just want to give you overview where in the world one of our knee show series, which is going to be the far side.

940
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Okay?

941
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:23,840
Okay, guys. Now that we know that two worlds of knee show, what I want to quickly explain to you is how I angle around my partner.

942
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Like I just explained to you, I'm a knee start going inside when I start getting to that far side of knee show.

943
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,840
It's important that you understand how I'm moving my body.

944
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Okay? So I'm here in knee show and I'm in this spot initially here, right?

945
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,840
In my knees outside of your body, just like you learn. And when my knees outside of my body, my hook is strong, right? So I'm here.

946
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,840
And I'm just controlling this leg for now.

947
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:57,840
As you guys will see, as my head is facing the shoulder, my body knee going inside her, this leg gives me two controls of her, like, half.

948
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:04,840
Because now this leg is going in as a bar of my hook. You see, what funny knee is here, it's talking her leg.

949
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,840
The same leg as if I had a bar of my hook. It gave me the same functions.

950
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:14,840
Because the bar of my hook, the pros of it are I could raise her leg, right? I can lift up her leg off the floor, right?

951
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:20,840
Well, I have to do a hug from this far side. Come on, you need to raise her up.

952
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,840
Exactly the same as a bar of my hook, right?

953
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,840
So that's what you're really going to notice is going to happen as many knee goes under her leg.

954
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,840
Okay. So now what I want you guys to see is how I'm angleing around her.

955
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,840
This is a great drill gesture practice, but it's really simple.

956
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,840
How are you going to see angleing around the person? I just want you to place your elbow on the floor.

957
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,840
Okay. Once my elbow is on the floor and holding the collar, you're just going to move my body where my elbow is.

958
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Okay. So I place my elbow on the floor, holding the collar, I'm just going to move my body where my elbow is.

959
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Hold my elbow like so, and now I'm just going to punch my body. So I'm here.

960
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:02,840
I pull my elbow forward, I'm just going to bring my body up, hold my elbow, close, bring my body right over my elbow.

961
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Now my hand is straight. Now my hand's on another shoulder. I'm going to go straight to see my feet movement.

962
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,840
So here, I'm training. I just sit on my elbow, then I get to punch my body.

963
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,840
So all you have to do is put your elbow forward and now you're bringing it in.

964
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,840
I'm going to put my body where my elbow is. Right? So I'm here. I just put my body where my elbow is.

965
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,840
And I end up right here. Okay. Now there's all the ways I can move my body as well.

966
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,840
Using my toes on the floor to walk, you see I can scrub my shoulder.

967
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,840
I can tuck my shoulder in instead of coming up, using my head.

968
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,840
But for now, all I'm going to do is to work is elbow and floor move your body.

969
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,840
Placing it right where your elbow is. And now I'm into this spot. Okay.

970
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,840
That's all I want to explain this section. I just want to quickly

971
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,840
Make sure you have an understanding of pain on yourself.

972
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,840
Because it's like you just start, there's two or three shoulder.

973
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,840
And if I can aim myself around her, I'm in the same side of your shoulder.

974
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,840
Right now we're working far side of your shoulder. So it's very important to understand.

975
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,840
You have to aim yourself to face this shoulder and then we're in the far side of your shoulder.

976
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:16,840
So now what I'm going to discuss, I just discussed how we're using that collar as a frame.

977
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:22,840
Now we're going to do exactly what we did on the other side, but we're going to do it on this side.

978
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Now I'm going to use my knee to reinforce my straight in my collar.

979
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:34,840
So before we learn about it, when I'm here, I'm going to show there as my first straight in, right?

980
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,840
And my hook, right? I bring my leg in and now she can't come forward or back.

981
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,840
So then we move my hands to the cross collar, but now I'm going to bring this shoulder to me.

982
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,840
I have to bring my hand, but why not? So bring this shoulder to me.

983
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Now look what I'm going to do. I'm just going to take my knee that below my shoulder.

984
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,840
I'm going to bring it up like so. Now everything.

985
00:51:54,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Now I have my knee and my hand both supporting the frame on this shoulder at the same time.

986
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:08,840
You see, so look out with more efficient. I'm using my body right now using my knee and my hand on this side.

987
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Completely the guarantee that you cannot be this shoulder forward, right?

988
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,840
And then she started to bring the other shoulder forward to shoulders.

989
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,840
Look how my hand is already there as well.

990
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,840
So I'm always using my knee, whenever my partner brings this shoulder forward,

991
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,840
to go right under my hand to frame this shoulder as well, okay?

992
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,840
So we already learned hooking the leg like so, right?

993
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,840
So we learned hooking the shoulder like so, framing here, switching the hair.

994
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Now what we're learning is how to frame with the collar here, and then they use our knee as well,

995
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,840
whenever she comes in with this shoulder, so bring this shoulder forward.

996
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:48,840
Now, all I'm doing is I take my knee, I sit right on top of, I sit right under, right?

997
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,840
I sit my hand right on top of my knee, right?

998
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,840
And that's all we're doing, it's a pillow bearer. I always define pillow bearer.

999
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:01,840
All my DVDs as it's literally just sitting on top and it's an extra support.

1000
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,840
Now I have two parts of my body, framing one spot.

1001
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,840
Obviously generating more strength, and it's way more efficient using my body.

1002
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,840
So I'm here. I'm wearing the collar with my knee right under my hand, nothing to do.

1003
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,840
Notice my chin is like a bar, right, a concert chest as well.

1004
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,840
Reading, I'm going to be seeing the feeling stronger as well because she can't break any part of our upper body.

1005
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,840
And today, seven, two, you say, so we're first here.

1006
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,840
We're a bookie, we're here, I think you might need to not come in there.

1007
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Now, both shoulders, being either shoulder forward, please.

1008
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,840
Both shoulders are completely stuck.

1009
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,840
And I have my hook under them.

1010
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Okay, so I want you guys to add this in now.

1011
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:45,840
So we already, so practice hooking the leg, practice framing the shoulder, practice family collar.

1012
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,840
Now we're going to add in that knee across the body, put your chin across the body.
