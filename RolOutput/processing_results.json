        "text": "Let's look at a situation that's further along. Remember what we did previous was perfect turtle. We haven't jeopardized anything. We haven't lost anything. But now, obviously, especially as we develop our ability to turn to turtle and fight out the position, we are going to make mistakes. They are going to take a hook, they are going to potentially have a seat belt. So, we're going to start with that because in a judicious setting, and again, even in an MMA setting, juditsu guys do MMA, a lot of good throwing that knee-side hook and dive on a seat belt like a backpack. That's why we're going to switch it around. Spencer is actually the size of a small carry on that. So, it's going to be very similar to a real backpack jumping on, right? We're going to talk about how, again, in this situation, this isn't even the end of the world yet, right? So, they are, again, they want a couple of battles. They've got the knee-side hook, they've got the seat belt, but we, it's where they're far from submitting us here. They're far from even stretching us out, taking a proper backpack here. We need to understand the inventory positions and how to position ourselves, so that they can't use this position too badly. So, let's look at it, let's go seat belt, knee-side hook. So, we have a bunch of strategies. We're going to have to deal with from this position, right? Obviously, we don't want them to take two hooks. If they have two hooks, they're completely different situation. It's a different situation because when they have two hooks, now they're hooks themselves. These two legs act as a way to hold spits on to mat. And it frees up his hands to go straight for chunks here, right? If he has one hook in, and we, and face the camera, face his eyes, and this knee is pinched really time, this is kind of like a fake hook here, right? This helped keep Spencer attached to a certain degree here, right? So, even in this position, we're still at risk. There's a potential that Spencer just goes for a chuck straight away, right? There's a ways this risk. So, what we're going to talk about is what we want to do here. And this is something called a hip-sit. Another great technique of stalling from wrestling, and we'll pretend that I created it, right? So, mat faces this way. So, what you can see, knee-side hook seat belt. This is your standards, due to back-take position. This is probably the earliest thing you would taught when someone turns away, throwing the knee-side hook, jump on a seat belt. And this is the thing that you see in MMA and in ADCC style events with more wrestling heavy guys. That's quite often you lose this position, you see the guy lose this position, and we're going to explain why that happens, right? So, mat's going to do something called a hip-sit. And he's going to sit on that inside hip, and he's going to collapse his chest 40, right? He's going to keep this elbow back and touch. Again, with lost one hook, we don't want to give him to walks here. Two hooks, that's really helping him, right? We're in this position here, you can see. Because we've sat to our hip, Spencer's butt is on the floor here. We've already reduced some of the load on us. We come back up to total. We're carrying Spencer's wet. We're carrying his weight here. We sit to a hip, and we're able to sit in such a way that he's butt on the floor. Now the ground is absorbing some of that weight here, right? What we're doing, there's some deep down here. We don't want to be stretched out. So if they stretch us out here, they throw that second hook, they can start attacking us with traditional style backtakes here, right? So we lean forward, we lean over the leg here, right? With a heavy emphasis on this shoulder going to the ground here. This shoulder position coming forward is what reduces their ability to stretch us out. So we've got a nice frame here. This hand here, we can be on the hand and we can be on the elbow here. This is fine. But this is ultimate in the position we want. What we want to do is we want to sit on their hook. You can see, Spencer's knee is above Matt's knee. If Spencer wanted to build high, he would have to shallow that hook out. And what do I mean by that? I mean, who's a shallower? And now he's back above Matt. His deep hookie took off the turtle is now costing him position here. That's what's holding him here. You can see again, Spencer's knee is above Matt's knee. Matt's chest is over the top of it here. And Matt's other leg, this knee is covering his fore ankle here. Again, let's say Spencer let go. I just tried to pull his hook out. It's surprisingly stuck. And it's stuck because this knee is forcing it out. The chest is covering it and this knee is above the ankle here, meaning with where should like this. He really ought to want to put up or he wants to knee down. But it's how to pull it here when we've got this angle. So we're killing that hook. That's your number one concerned positionally. Obviously, we don't want to get choked here, but it's as the seat belt well leaning forward. Spencer tries to choke even if we don't hand find it. It's pretty tough. It's a pretty tough angle here. So we're pretty good position. You're a defensive stretcher's stretcher's Matt out and throws in the choke now. It's a way easier. So again, us leaning forward is really putting us out of position for them to attack a choke. And in a sense, if they were to attack a choke, you're going to make it easier for us to get out. What we're doing here is Spencer is only holding this position because of his hand's hand grip it. If his hand's open, that'll be at any point. That's a good chance we just turn and get off the screen a lot of it. So what we're doing is we've changed the hand fought dynamic. If we're in a traditional backpack with two hooks and you've stretched it out, now you're led control this position quite well, whether it's hooks or a body triangle, freeing your hands up to the check. Matt's hands are also free and he's going to hand fight you. But now it's hands versus hands. If we go back to the hip set position, we're hand fighting you in a different way. You, your hands are preoccupied. The only way you can keep this position is by keeping the seat belt. So if the only way you can keep this position is by keeping the seat belt, we've eliminated the submission threat because you can't open your hands or you lose position. So it's a different way to think about us. It's a hand fight by preoccupying the hands. That's the way I want you to think about this position here, right? We don't have to be hand fighting and protecting us from being choked it because if his hands are preoccupied by trying to keep the position. The way we force ourselves out of this position is, again, I want Matt to keep this elbow back. We don't want him to get the second hook hit. If I am this hook and we try to come up, it's holding the behind us. It's making them heavier to turn, so we want to keep this back. We want to keep our elbow covered here. If they try to turn the hook now, the elbow blocks it. What we're going to look to do is ultimately grab their choking arm, their left arm with our right elbow here. But you can see Matt already did that very well. We're going to have to use a paw so if you're right. So sometimes we can't just reach the elbow. We might want to use our other hand to stop pulling it down and start securing a strong grip here now. What this is doing is pulling Spencer's shoulder down exactly like his hip pressure down to the ground. We're pulling this down and we're basically coming up to a certain position and pulling our elbows. They're falling off our back here. They have nothing to stay behind us, and we're basically pulling this arm down, shaking our breath. Start from the top of the head. So again, we've lost a couple of battles, lost the seat belt battle, we've lost the knee inside hook battle. We haven't lost the second hook that haven't got the second hook in hand. We're going to seat in such a way that we can't be stretched out. So we're going to sit on our hip, trapping their hook deep. We know Matt's done this move correctly because Spencer's butt is on the ground. If we come back up, if you guys haven't traveled, there's a common error is you see in such a way that Spencer stays right off the ground. This is incorrect. We're still carrying Spencer's entire body weight here. So we come back up to total. So we cut a shop or angle here and we sit and you can see Spencer's butt is firmly on the ground in this position. Let's take care of the important details here. We can't be stretched out because the way we're sitting. This shoulder is heavy in this direction. Their hook is stuck deep. That deep hook they took but they were very happy about getting. It's now what's costing them in this position hit. It prevents them adapting and changing the position hit. This leg, our right leg is covering the bottom foot. That's keeping a bit of weight of the foot to the ground. Our knee is directly below the knee. It means that leg is like this and our chest is covering the knee. They try to shallow out that hook to build hot. They can't do it. If they open the hands at any point we go. They lose position right. So again, they're going to recognize that very quick. Spencer in this position is going to feel like he doesn't want to open his hands. He's like, this is what's holding me on. No matter how hot he holds on here, that's all he's got at this point. He can't be repositioning his hips. He can't scoot back. If he opens his hands to change groups, we just get straight up. We cut a shop angle and that he does this. He's got throw his knee fall. If the hands come open to anybody. It's a losing battle here. Our hips are going to become higher than our partners hips and because their hip is wedged to the floor hip, they won't be out of follow. This will happen from time to time. Guys will try to make a quick grip exchange. I just want you to go. If they open their hands, it's a hard position to angle. Ultimately though, some guys will just try to ride the position out. Some guys will instantly feel the seat belt so they have and they won't try to take it grip change. Guys will probably try to throw a second hook in here. Our elbow blocks it. Just like our elbows protected this space when we're in total to begin with. We're in this position. The only way we're going to beat this seat belt is to secure that choking elbow. That will secure the arm above the elbow here. Matt's going to use a hand assist. He's going to grab it pull down. He's going to pass it off to the other hand. He pulls it. Not just down, but cross body too. If he pulls down and spins it keeps his head high, we land here. If he pulls down and cross body, he's shoulders coming across and we quickly start to come up to that total position. This is how we should address this position. Because if we come back, we come all the way back up to that total with the hook in. But here, suspense is going to have the time that you pinch the face direction. If this time, if this knee is tight, pinch against the hip, we're carrying all that weight here. Not one part of that body is touching the ground here. We want to see it. We want to do that hip set. Now, suspense is a lot of his weight is absorbed by the ground and he's really using muscular strength to try to be a burden to us back here. We're in the position. He caught shallow his hook. We immediately pass off. We secure suspense to trust the stand on the back here. He gets shook off. He gets shook off because he has no means to keep our hips to the ground. He doesn't have an ability to extend us. We've put his hips on the ground with the hips it and by controlling the shoulder or pulling a shoulder to the ground. Both our hips and our upper body will be above their hips and their upper body. That's the basic hips to deal with again. Knees side. Knees side hook and a seat belt. That's how we're going to address that position. We're coming like a waste count on people still going for the seat belt, right? Obviously guys are much more intelligent with their approach now. And the power half is going to be a strong sort of tactic for guys from this position, right? Any one of us jumped on the back and tried to throw in hooks and jumped on a seat belt has had the horrible situation. Just following over the top, pulling completely off again, balancing sticks with your while. So they switch it up. So we'll see a power half here. This is the demonstrator, right? Matt's on his hands here. And Spencer's on the back and he uses the power half to really force Matt to basically do a forward row. And we land in a situation where he's extended with stretched him out with the power half. This is the ultimate goal here. Power half is going to disrupt the ability to posture and climb and extend it now. That's why it's such a powerful move. What we can do to address the power half. Let's face Matt face your right more. All right. So we're in this situation here, right? Again, we've lost some battle. Spencer is under the farm market with lost that battle. Spencer's got the near side hook. We've lost that battle. What we're going to do here is essentially the same thing. It's the hipsuit again. The hipsuit will work for this too. The hipsuit is what we use seat belt power half. It's what we use when they're not under both arms. But in this situation, if we just sit to a hip, you'll see, Spencer's still pretty strong in this position here, right? Keep extending this way, face this way, bring your upper body to me. You can see, it's still pretty strong here. It's hard for us to find this elbow. The hips are quite attached here. We're going to have to add a bit of spice to this move, right? So we come back to the stuff. We're going to do, and again, you see these moves very common and grappling. We've already done one knee slice. We're going to have to do it again. Spencer face the flag. So create that angle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So for this situation, again, we're going to have to add some spice to it, right? We don't want to just sit down. We're actually going to hit a knee cut to basically throw Spencer's weight further this way. We have to add a step to do the knee cut. We need to do a bit of hot. If Spencer's already crushing the head hot, what I'll do is I'll place my palm on my forehead like this. Now Spencer cracks the power off. Why is this a bit of time here, right? And it allows us to hit this knee slide towards the camera. He creates a bit more hip separation here, right? So what's this map do it again by yourself. No Spencer anybody. He's probably feels the same anyway, but he's going to take that foothead, but it kind of looks like your board kind of looks like your annoyed your bothered by the situation. He lifts the leg and he slides hard this way. That means Spencer's weight goes from here and falls off the back. We create a bit more separation between Spencer's hips and our hips and that attachment is really the issue. So let's do a sense on the back. If they crank it straight away before head post, now we create a knee slide motion and you see it knocks Spencer off the back a little bit again. Let's understand the situation. Spencer's goal is to stretch us out if we're lazy without shoulder pressure here or if we over reach here, he stretches us out. He gets basically the exact same thing as if you hit it from the turtle. What we need to do, I'm going to get both of you guys to face your head this way. And we've got that power off. What we're going to do is we're going to look to reach for the elbow here. So Spencer starts to put a little pressure on with that elbow. We're going to grab it here. What's going to buy us some time. Look where the ground and our forearm is acting as reinforcement as another form of resistance to the power off and it allows us to pumble our head inside it. Once our head is inside, now Spencer can't put any more pressure on the neck. So come back as though. Here, if we don't do anything, the pressure on neck and then they can use that to stretch us out. You come back. Here we take a frame on the elbow. Now they try to do it. Now we've got we're really good structurally here. It's not even using any of our strength. Here, Spencer's having a used body strength to try to fight this. We take that frame and we slide ahead inside it. This is important here. Now we grab above the elbow. We're pulling that down hard. Spencer can't even let go if you wanted to. Now we're going to do the exact movement we did before, but what's key here is that we have to watch out for front head attacks. And if our grip on this arm is weak as we come up, we come up into a straight into a submission area. What makes that more difficult is we're not just pulling down on the elbow. We're pulling it towards our hips. And now as we hit this sort of bowel roll movement here, it allows us to pass the underhook inside. That really really helps us sort of mitigate the front head attack here. So again, you will see, you did see guys hit the bowel half. If we hit this escape on my lazy, they're going to hit a front head attack. So we pull over with lazy here. We're right into that seated cut of the tummy. We potentially even anything could happen here, regular guillotains, whatever. We're in our power half. We reach for the elbow here. That buys us the time to pump our head inside. That is step one. If we come back, if we just use our right hand to reach for the elbow, that allows us to stretch ourselves. That compromises our base and our structure because we need to be heavy with the right shoulder here to prevent them from doing this. If they crank it here, we can do the forehead post again and then we can find the elbow. Now our Spencer's trying to crank, allows us to pass our head inside. Pull down and pump over the top. Again, with turns, as well as really a bad position for us and we've been able to turn within them. Then trying to make us carry their weight. And obviously if we stay in that sort of position, we're carrying that weight. We carry that weight into the stretch ourselves out and extend us and take a traditional back take. What we're doing is we're using their fullling body weight against them. We're positioning ourselves in such a way that their weight falls not into us, but off of us onto the grounds. Now the grounds carrying their weight and we take that frame head inside, grab the elbow. That should be, that should you should build that into a really strong habit. Power half is not something you want to fight. You flat power half, you're going to destroy your neck. So we have to try to use whether applying pressure against them. They want to hit the power half when we're building height, we're trying to shake them off the top in a full point position. Either way, here, over here, when we're here, and we frame on the elbow, now power half through it is completely jeopardized. We're taking that away from it, allowing us to tune within, shake them off. Any time someone is applying fullling body weight into us, if we position ourselves correctly, we can shake that weight and use that weight against them. What we want to address now is a different position again, right? So this time they have a previous battle hook and a seat belt hook and a power half, right? What we want to address now is when we're in the turtle and we build one leg up, we're up on one leg, but this time we've lost a battle. We haven't lost a battle for a hook, we've only lost one of the battles. Again, previous we lost a hook and the upper body battle. This time they haven't secured a hook, but they've secured a seat belt or a body belt. We need to have instinctual reactions based on where their grips are and they're going to be two different reactions. If we give the wrong reaction when they have a seat belt and no hook, they're likely going to jump hooks. If we give the wrong reaction when they have a body belt, we're likely going to be driven back to the ground. So we needed to distinguish how we respond to those upper body grips and those reactions need to be quick, right? So let's look at the situation. First of all, when Matt started climbing for a hunt, but Spencer secured a seat belt. So in this situation, we need to understand what the seat belt does. The seat belt maintains upper body height. It gives an incredible ability for if Matt would have stand straight up. For us to stay above them, throwing hooks here, right? You will see in MMA, guys stand up in this situation. But again, in a pure grappling sense, we wouldn't do that. In MMA they'll use the cage to peel them off. It's easy to grab the gloves, pummelahum over the top. In a pure submission grappling setting, I would never stand straight up if they have a seat belt because it can't look. They, they stay attached face to camera. This arm is what keeps them attached. If they had double under this here, and we stood straight up straight to go, keep the hooks and stand straight up. It's harder to stay attached here. We start pulling down the body. We needed to distinguish those two grips. In this situation, we need to address it differently. We're going to address it with a full point position here, right? Because the advantage to the seat belt is we stay above when they stand up. So again, one more time, that's the advantage to the seat belt. They stay above. The disadvantage to the seat belt is they can fall forwards. So if Matt starts forepointing in circle, he falls forward in the last match to take another one. Let's do that again from a different angle. That's the same track. So Matt's only lost one battle here. The hooks are still protected. Matt might even keep his elbows pretty tight here. It's hard to jump hooks. In this situation, if we were a full point in circle, Spencer falls forward. There's nothing keeping him attached here. In this situation, if we did the full point, and they had double under this body block here, and we did the full point. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Spencer stays behind the arms here. And in that situation, Matt stays in forepoint, there's a good chance, Spencer, who either the turning or die of hooks. Because again, what the body does say in that position? If Matt shakes here, Spencer ain't going nowhere. If Spencer has a seat belt, and he shakes, he falls forward. To beat the body load, we feel it high. To beat the seat belt, we shake. If we did the wrong reaction to you, those two things, we help them here. So again, to beat the seat belt, don't stand up. Stand up, they stay above you. To beat the seat belt, circle and shake. Even in that process, if they do die of a hook or two hooks, there's a good chance they're going to full straight up. They might fall off in the process of getting hooks, but you even get a shake them off, even if they secure two hooks. But you get a slow process involved with a bit of shaking right, but there's a good chance they lose it here. If we have a body load, and we give the wrong response, we do the full point response. He can jump hooks. No matter how hard we shake, I'm just getting going to happen here, right? Come back and step, start again with the body load. If we have a body load, we want to beat with a high. If we beat with a high and they go to jump hooks, why the perfect grip, let's say, for example, you would have had such a standing jump hooks. He's going to full straight to the ground, we can even bounce in. So again, you can see how given the wrong response gives them a perfect position. You need to understand this conceptually and build reactions based off their grips. I don't want you to start being like, oh, we do this. They do that. We do this conceptually. We beat double-unders with head height. We beat the seat belt by shaking them over the toe. Obviously, when we have, and they have the body load here, double-unders, they're not going to waste jump hooks. That's going to be a bad response. We're going to have to do here as we step forward. We control the hands and we break the grip over the extended hips. We try to drag the hands lower than our hip and bring out hip forward. Now here we can turn immediately back in and start wrestling again. So, I want you to practice this. It's going to be two correct responses and two bad responses here. Let's look at the position and let's start with the incorrect response. They have a body load. They're behind two arms. If we four point here, they jump hooks. They've got the back. Bad response. What do we try to understand? They're behind two arms. We're never going to shake them over us. But we're going to be able to help them down so we stand up. We attack the grip. We stretch it down. That's the correct response. You'll see how natural that feels. We're in a seat belt here. We try to stand straight off. They stay on our back. Again, here, they're never going to fall down. If they have the arms up, they're going to fall down. If they have the arms up, they're going to fall down. If they have the arms up, they're going to fall down. If they have the arms up, they're going to fall down. So when we have the seat belt, we're shaking them forward here. We're going to circle on a four point and they're feeling off of that point. This needs to be just bills into you here. You need to remember this so you can react quickly into these circumstances. But again, double on this. We bring the hands down. We're just attacking. There's no one grip that's going to protect you from all body movements. So we're just trying to generalize between double on this and a seat belt and attack appropriately. All right, let's talk about one of the last stages of the total rep. So we've obviously talked about how to stand up. We haven't lost any battles. So no seat belt, no body luck, no looks. We just spoke about previously using the hips. When they have won both battles, we also just spoke about when they've lost the upper body battle, but no hooks. So what to do now, let's talk about it when we've built a bit of high, but they've thrown in one hook. So Matt's down. He's got one knee up. If you've got the inside of it and they've got the seat belt here, right? Let's face this way here. Both of you guys face the left one. Walking here on the steering about this position here, right, is Matt's trying to build high, but he's carrying all of Spencer's weight. This is obviously vertically challenged, but this knee pinch here is attaching him to Matt here. So here, if Matt would have tried a full weight, he could do it, but he's going to carry a lot of weight to do it. If we can address this knee pinch here. So ideally, we would use that elbow here. So Spencer's brings this knee time. We can try to use that elbow if we can reach, we can use our hand, as soon as we push that off, that foot hits the ground. Let's do that again, but keep turning left so we can see how the foot hits the ground. So just so you guys really understand this, right? One way you know Matt's carrying all of Spencer's weight is it's not one part of Spencer's body touching the floor. Matt clears this foot and he's always going to other power though, as he pushes it, Spencer's foot hits the ground. Now, the ground is absorbing a ton of Spencer's weight and Matt can much easier four points. And now, Spencer's becomes fooling body weight as our hips rise higher than they hips are. So if you're in this position, you're trying to build lightly throw a hook. You instinct your response is going to be at a four point. And for pointing here, it's still going to be pretty effective, but it's not going to be efficient. We're going to be carrying a lot of weight as we do it. So when we feel this and we're going to feel this knee pinch right into the hip hip. Exactly, use that exact motion again, bring this knee down. Now, we're carrying his weight here. So we reach back and we push on the foot. The foot hits the ground. We're going to gear it at the ground because the ground's going to stop absorbing weight and we should immediately shake them off the top hip. That's what we're going to do when they have a seat belt, right? But again, just to cover when they have the seat belt on the knee side hook, what we're not going to do when we push the foot off is push the straight up because they're going to jump on our back as we keep standing. They're going to grab exactly. That's the wrong response for a seat belt, right? But it is the right response for a body load. So if Spencer is on the both arms here and he's got the body lock here. Four pointing, tell the response here. So we still beat this. So we still reach back and knock this down and we four point. We haven't achieved much here because he's under both arms under both arms. They can't fall forward. But under both arms, they can fall down. So again, we could try to stand here but we're carrying all that way. We want to address this foot, this knee. So we push it, hits the ground and every stop climbing for high. And they stop the foot. They've got a hook in. So that goal is clearly to take the back. So again, under both arms. They've got a knee side hook, five side knee pinch it. No part of Spencer's body is on the ground. That means we are solving their entire body weight hit. There are energy efficient ways to get up. They just require more steps. Matt reaches back and clears that knee and he stands twin. There's nothing about Spencer's grip that prevents him falling down. Just so you can see it with similar size legs. Matt has the knee side hook. And he has the seat open. And he has this knee pinch. So you see, it's got to look more like a knee would try to adjust. That hits the ground. Now it's much easier for us to shake. But it looks good. And we got one leg up. We address this. Watch out a stand here. Super exhausting. I push that jump. I stand straight up. So again, it's going to look more like a dealing with this knee here. That knee is what we have to address. If the knee is pinching, we're carrying all that weight. Deal with the knee. Four point for a seat belt. Deal with the knee. Stand straight up for your body. The summarized this section, right? We think everything you know about total right. We think the value as a position, right? Even if this ultimately, you don't want this to be a big pot of your gang, you know, you're still going to be wanting to play offensively. Or if your butt and offensively looking for submissions off your butt, it's still good to know how to get up. It's good to know how to be safe and total. We need to learn these skills, right? So we covered a pretty broad approach, right? We covered the perfect total, how to get up. And then we covered, we isolated it down to how to deal with it when we lose certain battles. But you can practice this stuff at home solo. And actually, you really don't even need to have mats to do this. You know, we're not moving around on our back. It's not going to be uncomfortable. You could do this on any form of ground. You can do like sort of shadow drilling, imagining different scenarios. So mats down in his turtle, he can practice just imagining that someone behind him, right? So you can see he's got a perfect total here. He can practice the skills of trying to build high and get up without conceding anything. He can practice these skills. Again, this is very, very important because total is risky. You know, like if you stand up incorrectly, you might get bombed and soup lexed, foot swept, embarrassed around. So you have to do patient here. This isn't an escape series where you get out quickly. And you make fast movements of fast decisions, right? We need to be patient. We need to be safe. We need to be imagining good fights. Even in this situation, back can pretend they have, we need to do a hip-suit here. So you can practice sitting to a hip and he can practice clear. And at the proper, let's go see about hip-suit here, just sit to the side. And he's sitting here, he practices pummeling clear and turn him back in. Let's say he's got one leg up. And he imagines someone throwing a hook here. And then he thinks, oh, do they have a seat belt? Or does they have double on this? Before point it, so we imagine it's a seat belt. Just don't let's imagine they have double on this. He steps straight up and clears those gears. That should be basically the fundamental skills. I honestly believe having the ability to stand up from total should be something you learn around what blue belt, right? But even for me, I only started working on these skills when I really focus on trying to help in the main fighters. So they have to know how to get out for these positions. And it's more a wrestling skill set. But obviously, we have to deal with other threat set of submissions. So we still need to approach it in a way that protects our neck at all times. You know what I mean? A lot of wrestling rules sets. They can't lock their hands from those sort of referees positions. So we have to think about how we can address the situation dealing with a lot of pants. But again, it should be a fundamental skill set. You should be out of stand up from total. Technical stand up, junk. Great and theory. But really, that's not saving you. I mean, technical stand ups, good. If that's halfway across the room, we can get up. But if he's over me, this is not technical stand up here. You know what I mean? If I need to get up, I need to be exposing my back to get up. So guys, we need to develop them. If you ask a coach, how do you stand up and he says, technical stand up? Maybe ask him how to get up from total. You know, I'm not going to be too judgmental, but you shouldn't know. All right. So I know what you're thinking. If cycle control is fake, because they can total. What do we do to prevent them from traveling? Right. If we see, if we get on top of a God, we go, we've got to keep this guy down. And cycle control. We know it's a pathway to total. And we know it's a disciplined total position. It's a great pathway for them to stand up. Then how do we keep them down? And the answer is half God. Most people, and especially me for the longest time, because of the way we approached you, Jitsu. I always saw half God as a failed pass. Or really, me not holding cycle control now correctly. And I would be pushed back to half God. Where obviously, you know, after you can get a advantage for getting someone to a strong half God, and then they retain that God, right? So in a way, if it's rewarded, but it's not rewarded very well. Half God is primarily a peeing position. Half God controls the legs in a way that cycle control ignores. It ignores completely. A good half God, and especially a half God primarily focused on inside leg control, is one of the hardest positions to find a pathway out. And a good strong half God talk. And we look at the bottom God. There's no submissions there. There's no leg attacks. There's no inversions. They can't get up. Even cycle control has bullshit like the body control. Psych control, people are using that offensively now. Jero the asshole. Very good on the cycle control. He doesn't really even see it as a bad position because he's so offensive from that. And he's a hot guy to pin and hold down because he can move so much. A guy with Jero's sort of athleticism, flexibility. You would rather pin him inside in the half God than cycle control. If we pin the upper body, they cannot turn into us from cycle control. We flatten the mouth. If we control the legs, even without any upper body, they can't turn away a leg. We're going to talk about obviously if we sit in a shitty half God, obviously I can do a lot of things. But if we sit in half God's top, in a way we can control the legs. Primarily, the inside leg, we eliminate a ton of that ability to move. A good half God pin, the God won't want you to pass. That's how you know you're heading in the right direction. When I filmed pal at top, we're talking about how we can fatigue the bottom play without side passing. And we know that getting tied if they try to stand up. A good half God pin, we know where effective from it, if that basically trying to get us a pass. But this half God controls both below the hips and controls the upper body. It's the strongest pin position. There's a reason, and it may fight as a lack to stay in half God. Again, I tell all my guys, we go half God to mount and potentially back to half God. I never recommend going to cycle control. And I'm just going to try to show you some of the reasons why throughout this next part. So we take downs in lines, and obviously we want to pin out of the take down. It is better to secure the inside leg to the half God as they hit the ground. Rather than complete a double leg to cycle control. If you look at ADCC, I believe they call a clean take down to cycle control. And they reward that with more points and just simply take down to a full God or a half God. Which to me makes sense only in that it's more difficult to pin someone in cycle control. But in a sense I feel like we should be rewarded for a better pin position. Which again, you double leg someone to close God, full God. Even if the legs are open, you're getting the pin points. As I'll show you now, so if Matt double-expensive. Let's say you finish as a very traditionally varied to cycle control, right? And we'll stop here. People think cycle control is rewarded. In a sense, if we pass the legs, we get rewarded for it with obviously passing points, right? But if we focus on landing in cycle control out of a double, as mass secures it. It's very difficult for him to stop spends attining away your time with creating a scramble out of here. People always elect to shoot the double to cycle control. But adding a step and securing it to a half God, right? So Matt creates a double leg. He elevates any steps over the inside leg. And he uses the inside leg to keep spends his knee facing more towards the flag behind us. And now, spends it tries to turn, even without upper body control. He cannot turn. So everything's context-dependent. So half God, if we were in front of a leg, so we passed the half God, it's not rewarded very much. We passed the cycle control, we passed the God, it's rewarded. But there's a time out of place for things, and it's much better to control someone in half God. Expensively it's flat on his back here. If we hold the far hip, and we just hold it with our hand, just our hand and we push it up. Spence a power to total. He can go. We come back. We hold his inside knee to the ground. Now we trust the total. We believe in it. The most powerful part of the total movement, which is his lower half. When we float it on pinning people, we want to not only control the legs, but primarily want to control the bottom leg, even in a God recovery situation, right? So think about this, right? Spence his flat on his back here. He hits a hip-esket. He hits a hip-esket. Come back. Come back. Do a big hip-esket movement, exaggerated hip-esket. It's a big movement, and it requires the retraction of his lower leg, right? Face the other direction. Do it through the same leg that just did it. To get his hips back. He's inside leg. Has to come back. If we face the other direction, Maddie, Maddie's in half got it. If Maddie sits strong on that bottom leg, and he really applies weight down to it, especially if that footgun hit the floor. Now when Spence a tries to hip-esket, he can put his foot on the ground. But he's hips don't go anywhere. When it comes to control, when it comes to pinning, there's no greater control than the control of the inside leg. Whether that's foot off the ground, whether that's pinning it. We're going to show you different bunch of ways. Whether it's a wrestling Turk style, that is our primary concern with control. We want to control the inside leg. You can see that demonstrated most clearly through a double leg to side control, or a double leg where we hook that inside half got it. Let's look at a broad range of leg Turks, right? Leg Turk think about it as a way of controlling the inside leg. Obviously it has a different message, a different meaning in wrestling and stuff, but for me, in terms of a few institutes, I'm thinking about controlling that inside leg in such a way that inhibits movement, whether that's pinning it, elevating it, hooking and scrolling, getting different ways to do it. Let's look at the most simple one here, right? That's the half done I'm talking. So what he's going to do is he's going to back your with his right ankle. Important detail here, don't point your toes. Obviously we point out toes, things like heel hooks, map does a lot of ballet, but if you back your with pointed toes here, you're going to get cramping it off. So we want to keep that active, that we don't just want to back your, because if we just back heel, it's been to could probably still pull that leg out. He can retract his knee in front of it, hip it. So we want to back heel, and we want to spill. So now we're applied basically all about body weight to the point of the knee, and we're elevating that foot here. We're creating, again, just like we did in previous section, we're creating this. That's hard, very difficult to retract it. They want that foot load of the ground, and it's easy to pull the knee up. For now, again, don't worry about the upper body. We're going to isolate this movement down. We want to control the hips, the legs, then we move up the body. If you go to half got you get to agree, you rush up the body, you lose everything. You lose what you have, right? You want to inhibit movement, and then progress the pants. So you can see here, we back heel, and we spruled those hips, heavy. Maths positioning again, you can see most of his weight is on the trapped leg. There's really not a lot of Spencer can do with his other leg. If he tries to hip his leg, his legs is on it. And we saw that to hip his leg effectively, you need to be out of retract the inside leg. Even the way Maths spruling, butterfly got a half butterfly, very difficult too. Maths spruling close to the ankle here. Typically speaking, I would away say, inside half got me on the floor. You're vulnerable to the young way in the knee level. But if you can't get his foot to the floor, he can't hit those movements here. So a great pinning position here, right? For the sake of positioning, Maths heavy, heavy over the hips. He might even have his elbow, just cupping the hips here. Nothing fancy, just holding the hips in place, and he's heavy here. I want you to practice pinning from here. So Spencer's going to wiggle around a bit. Very difficult here, right? Let's stop back in the regular half cut. Now, Matty hits the toe. Back heel, sprule, and sometimes he has to adapt there, right? Sometimes he might sprule slightly towards the foot. Sometimes he sprules down body. He just makes sure he maintains control. This is going to be a fluid movement. You don't want to be too strict there. I don't want to be like you have to be here at all times. We're inhibiting movement with this mechanism. And if we have to adjust on the fly, we have to adjust on the fly. We can combine this when the double leg takes down. So if Mat hits the double, and immediately turns. He immediately catches it and sprules. Spencer freaks down. He can't get out. Again, basic tuck number one. We might, well, let's flip it. Let's just show you that even smaller legs on top of slightly longer legs. Still be effective too. He hits the double, steps over until half cut. As long as he back heels, and he back heels with the active ankle. He's keeping that foot off the ground outside the move. So it's going to work. No matter the size of the scrap it's here. Turn number two. This one's been a real favorite of mine lately. And I'll explain why as we go along. But this is a different form of tuck. So it's going to use two legs to control this bottom leg ramp. So Mat's on top in half cut here. What is going to look to do? He's going to look to pummel. He's left foot all the way under the knee here. And he's already starting to create a control, but it's not enough of a control. Because you say if we stay here, they can still attract the knee. It's always about killing that knee, retracting. So we're going to lock it over our other leg. And we're going to keep that active cross. We're going to back heel with both legs. We're going to flab both knees wide. Heavy heavy emphasis on hip to hip pressure. When Mat's hips are hitting high hip, it keeps the knee elevated. And again, we've got this crooked sort of angle in the leg. Very hot to retract. If we were super, if that hips were too high and I mean sort of they close together, they'll still be able to pull that knee down. So again, we need that hip spruity. We can control the legs. And again, like I'm going to talk later, we're going to address the upper body here. So this is the control you see. See if you stop freaking out. It's very hot to do it. Very hot to clear that leg. It gives us some time to stabilize the position. Before we move up the body. The reason I really like this position is because it's a great Onto the half butterfly grab. Half butterfly grabs a pain in the ass to do with grab. So we switch angles here. We start in a half butterfly. And head this way for the signal. So you see, he's got the half butterfly. But it's not a great half butterfly. We're still honking in. We've been able to secure this leg in. So now we go back to the angle we were. Let's start with a regular half guard. But they got a half butterfly. So we don't have that leg pomo tissue. So now we're going to pop allow foot into place here. And we're going to bring out the leg over. Lock it up. Hit flip. And now try to use a half butterfly. And if we eliminate the bottom leg. We eliminate a great get of the threat with the half butterfly. And just by how they pungle that foot into the half butterfly. It actually does present than the a much better angle here to get this catch. The hardest part of getting the sensitivity in your leg to keep fighting the knee. So let's go back to the very beginning here. Go half butterfly in there. We're heavy here. So we need to be really. It's going to take a lot of practice again. I isolate this down to practice this full pungle sequence here. But we're going to wrap our foot inside and hook with the toes first. We catch the knee. Then we pass off the athlete. And we'll pass off into a perfect position here. Heavy heavy pressure keeps the knee in foot elevated. The half butterfly is dead. We're heavy heavy on the upper body here. We're not allowing them to push us through fire. But again for the sake of it. We're practicing lower half pins before we progress on the upper body pins. This control here again. Super effective. Great answer to the half butterfly that. Most things in your gits are going to be hot up on bigger opponents. A lot of things will work very, very well on people the same size as you. But bigger guys will be difficult. Leg Turks are one thing that are tougher on smaller buttons. Obviously once you get it, smaller people will fight regardless of the gits. But it's harder to wrap that legs up because it's less purchase we can get on. This next one would be the most difficult to develop the skills to do. Both in terms of you doing it and the leg pummeling. And in terms of you trained upon it's given the right reaction. A lot of the time they're going to panic and tab it's got the pressure on the knee. That's fine obviously stop reset. But I'm going to talk through this one now. So we're in the half guy. We're in the top here. We're going to do a very similar pummel to what we did in the previous one, right? So we're bringing that foot underneath it. So again here. We're going to even this is quite a strong position, right? It's going to take a few movements here. Look, look, look, look. And he's out of there. So even that initial elevation is really good. But we can actually create a bit better in a angle on this tug. But instead of doing the lock down, we're going to do and push on that ankle here. Now we're creating tension. We're creating lateral, knee by pressure. And that's actually going to stop their ability to move the hips here. Now when they try to do the same amount of wiggling, the foot is isolated in this position. The way the foot's elevated, they try to turn in. They try to turn to the right, they'll be more pressure on the knee. You can see how I mean, again, potentially if Matty Clark was a current which he used, he could get an E by it. Obviously, probably not a competition. They're going to wait a bit longer. But in this situation, turning in provides more pressure to this position. They can't elevate us overhead. They can't push us down. All they can do is try to turn away from the half gut. But now we're able to wrap it up with what's considered kind of an outside leg turkey. So you see, we've controlled the ankle. It's pinched between our knee pit here. We've got hip to hit pressure. I would recommend Matty step up with his right foot, knee high. And we drive way forward. We don't even need to touch the other leg at this point. Spence is trying to move. Very, very tough to move. And we can choose to step to mount any time we want. Come back one step. Rotate to your right. All both of you rotate to your right. Obviously, Span, you can see. I love doing this because Span's a combo. So this is the ankle area, right? There's really nothing Span's can do to prevent our stepping to mount. Sometimes we go back and step. Sometimes guys, if we're a little too low here, we try to put this foot on the hip. But here, just lift it and step up with that leg. Now Spence it, try to move. Excellent pin. Anytime we want, we can push that leg down. And step straight on it. So this guy, again, outside leg turkey. We're out focusing on the low body. Keep it in movement in the lower half. She's going to lead to us to get a strong pin that ultimately leads to us. We pin that leads to a pass rather than we try to force an upper body pin before we have adequate control of the lower body. So one more time there. We're in half God. Well, we should have exactly the same way as the previous one. We perform with that leg underneath. Elevate that button inside foot. We start to push that foot across without secondary. So again, this is difficult for people. You kind of can see what you're feeling doing. It's all feel based. But you know exactly where their leg is. It's in between your legs. So enough practice. You've got to develop this. Test it out. Spence it tries to get out. Tough aim to move. There's only one way you can move. Turns away. If you are having trouble turning away, come back on stuff. The trick here is if you're on bottom and you feel a knee bar pressure. It actually feed your leg deeper. And that allows you to find the ankle that time. So again, we don't force this. We put them in a position that they have to give us this. And now it can control over the outside toe again. Spence it for example. This is one I would say most people don't freak out on, because you can see. That's quite a tough angle on the knee and hip there. Most people are going to panic. Ultimately, like I said, previous ones, you'd have passed. Because I'm Maddie Passes. Now Spence it can start to freak out. But obviously we've upgraded position now.",

        "text": "Let's do a bonus one, right? So obviously the first three we did, we're from a pure half guard setting where we could, we could set it up from a traditional half guard. Because again, we're focusing on the valuable half guard, rethinking it as primarily a ping position that leads to a pass, rather than sort of this intermediary position for both top and bottom guard. So we're going to talk about some forms of staples, but again, this is not going to happen naturally, out of a traditional half guard setting. You might, inside of a scramble, have ended up in side control, you want to step back to this style of the position. That's primarily the use of this style of staple. So it spends his deal, and that is, let's see, that is inside control here. So all the way to side, let's face heads, this does. The way we set on the staple is not basically steps to half guard with these right leg, but keeps these for that side. Any staples here. This is a staple because it's complete pining on top. Some things to think about with this staple here, maybe he has applied what's basically a crab ride style of a guard for pure staples. All the recommends are extending the toes, and not trying to touch our toes on the ground and trying to sit out but directly on that foot here. Now our weight is completely on their lower leg. If we activate our ankle and put our toes on the ground, no matter how high we sit, the ground still absorbs some of the weight. You find guys actually much better at sliding than knee back here. But if we come back, we extend the toes and sit heavy on the foot. Now much harder to clear that foot here. So this would be one form of pure staple from this position. Again, addressing the issue of hip escape, so this one, and addressing the issue of totally. Spents his knees facing this direction, he tries to turn this way. Then if his inside knee is completely pinned, then he can't use that foot, he can't retract it, hip escape's gone. Again, not a position we'd hang out for a long time already, so close to a good position here. Another form is we could reinforce it without a leg. Now we're really hooking it from both directions here. He we still want to sit heavy on it, but it's not as important that we really point the toes here. Because we're hooking it with both directions without foot here. Again, here they're knees pointed to the right, they can't turn to the left. They can't keep us going, no matter how high they stand this foot to the floor, they just burn an energy here. What's an evening movement is mat's leg position, and that's basically out of reach for Spents into a dress right now. Another one we can do is we keep a left foot staple and we shelf their left leg. So we staple here and we shelf this leg up. Now we've effectively eliminated both legs from any form of ground movement, any form of them putting their foot on the ground to move. This would be the hip escape leg, this leg weights completely on it here. So let's face camera direction, here's one, keep on keep on keep on keep on keep on. So see this a great way to fully pin the hips, we've stretched the groin, we've shelfed the outside leg, and again like always we've killed the inside leg here. Once a freaks out, it's just burn an energy here, and that's something I want you to think about throughout. Traditional jiu-jitsu, we're having a in-between battle into one of us gets a position, and then we stay quite stable. This is a type of control where Spents are really going to try to burn energy, he feels like this is a great area position. So we try to fight as hard as possible, start a traditional points going position, and he uses a lot of energy trying to clear this. Really, go as panic in these in-between, peaning style positions, because it's not something that familiar with. If you know where you are, if Spents is in just a traditional after, no legs or anything, Spentsa has built in responses that he can efficiently use to address the situation. When you put someone in an unfamiliar position, they start to panic, and they start to burn a lot of energy here. They don't know what's going on. When you're up, when things are unfamiliar, that's when you burn the most energy. That's what I'm most like about leg turks, leg pin controls, you put them in an area they don't understand, and they burn a lot of energy. Just trying to get back to an area where they have strategies from. Let's look back across face as you're at, so with your dress lower body pins, let's address upper body positioning, and then again at the end, we're going to put it all together right. So we're going to have Spentsa laying down in this place this way, which is not top off right here. It's a little more isolating if we control the lower body, now we're going to address the upper body, then we're going to combine it right. The cross face everyone knows, most simple one, reach, middle finger far armpit, pull them into you, collapse your shoulder on that head here right. Standard, everyone knows that one right, but again, we have to cover a right, middle finger far armpit, pull them to you, drop the shoulder in the head. Spentsa's trying to move it, it's pretty painful right. There's nothing wrong with that, that's really good, especially it's really good for longer on people, but if you would build like Spentsa, and we needed to do a shallow cross face, I prefer this one too person because it's big quicker. Basically, we just slap them in the face gently, and we pull their face down to the floor and collapse the shoulder. Really big fan of this one is again, we're going to have to reach as far for the pinky far armpit, we have to reach super far this one. We just give my last slot, pull their head down, collapse our weight on top of the expenses, trying to move very difficult things to move here right. So again, two basic ones, but again, we can use a bit of a combination of the pressure here right. For me, mostly some of the worst cross faces I felt, I felt like it was more peck than shoulder hit. I feel like some guys would really powerful cross face, some take a shallow grip, and it's almost like they're breastfeeding here. It collapsed the peck on top of the face, they'll have their weight distributed a bit higher, and they're forehead to the floor here. So you see if Spencer's trying to move you, very difficult, right? So again, just subtle differences in cross face pressure here. But again, just simplify things, if we have a shit cross face, they turn into us. Spencer turns in, that's a terrible cross face, right? Some of the things to think about right, obviously most gyms, most hobbies, there's unspoken politeness to cross faces. You know, I mean, if there's one guy in the gym, that's cross face and people really hard, he's still going to be ostracized, right? But something I found amongst some of the best half-guide pauses is they're missing that gene entirely. Then shameless, about the amount of cross face pressure down here, and it sounds horrible, it's the truth. I find most people that come across half-guide are a bit too polite. So if you want to practice half-guide pausing, pick a training body, you feel comfortable with doing this to, right? Obviously, Spencer's. So I think Spencer really enjoys this, but again, shallow peck, we're using the peck here, so again, differentiator, right? We've got the shoulder in the jaw, sometimes the shoulder in the jaw, I feel like slips underneath, and Spencer can still turn over. That's why I'm a really big fan of the peck here, so we take that shallow grip when we put a peck over. Now, Spencer tries to slip up, super difficult here, but again, obviously, it is unpleasant. So cross face hot enough to pass, I mean, if you really don't like something, you just practice holding the cross face probably again, impolite, but you really need to be a bit aggressive with the cross face here, because the standard way people get out of half-guide is to turn it in and bring the inside knee back. If we can pin that face and prevent them turning in, we turn them away. We can do that with fire on tip, slap, or peck, play around with the most, see what you feel most comfortable with. But understand them, well, because they're all going to work best on different body types, different opponents. You've got to get a natural sense for which one you prefer, but again, some of these are quicker than others. And that's why I kind of lean towards the latter, too, rather than the initial pinky middle finger. And that's basically a short summary of three styles of cross face. We're going to talk about the knee side under hook, knee side under hook to me, number one, half guard, upper body, positive grip. Above and beyond, the best control position, right? So I'm going to show you a few details about it. I'm also going to show you why I believe it is number one and sort of an escape. I'm going to sort of highlight the escape with a cross face and why I think knee side under hooks best. So, Spencer helps down first of all, let's talk about what it is, right? Far side under hook would be mats right on his hips and his upper body to his left. So far side would be he's all right. So the opposite side to the half guard lock would obviously be the far side. Knees side would be closer to his lock. So we're down here, we have a knee side under hook, right? Knees side under hook works just as well as a cross face in a sense that the bottom guard cannot turn in, Spencer can't turn it. So we look at a cross face, what does a cross face do? Prevent some turning in. Knees side under hook does the same thing and probably a more polite way, honestly. Effectively controls the same thing. What we want to make sure is that our elbow is close to their elbow. But we don't open to man, if we go too far, elbow comes back in. So you want to be as close to the elbow as possible because that's the weakest point of sort of the lever here in a sense that we can lift their elbow high. If our elbow is under their armpit, they can bring that elbow down. And that's why I think a lot of people have trouble with the knee side under hook because they're too close to the armpit hit. If we're here and we go incorrect, we're not going to be able to walk our hand high. If that elbow is close to their elbow, and they resist. Much, much weaker here. But again, it's going to take some practice because obviously sometimes you're going to go too far, elbow is going to come back in. Sometimes you're not going to go far enough and they're going to keep their elbow low. So we need to play around with that. The reason it works, if I can demonstrate it now, yeah. Follow to hit a throng line, fight another hook here, and my elbow is under their armpit. That could be heavy with his elbow here. Even if he's not so far down and I'm trying to go, it's heavy. If I'm elbow to elbow here, now we're going to weaker point to throw in blood. But again, it's going to take practice because sometimes you'll be too far, you get another. Not too shallow because it's too heavy. We want to be elbow to elbow. That's little by exactly the same. So again, play around with the training bonus. Practice not going too shallow and not going too deep. Now you might be asking, how do we get a knee-side under the hip? We come back here. We always start by going through a cross-face. They don't defend the cross-face. We have a cross-face. We have elbow body control here. We want aggressively to our cross-face. They always block it. Now we pumble that thumb inside and immediately control at the elbow here. That's how we're securing it, right? Again, when we do it, be aggressive with the cross-face. That builds that response. You're activating something in where they're not even conscious and thinking. They're just reacting to it. What does that do? A less space for us to pass the under-up here. If we meet resistance, say what climb in the under-up line, halfway out with struggling, maybe it's here. Maybe it's a bigger opponent, maybe someone very physically strong. Very mind, where structurally sounds, they're using muscular strength. Their resistance will be short-lived here. But if they're resisting, every time they try to bring their hand back as a frame, climb a bit higher. So we've got them here. Whenever they try to bring this back in, the elbow will be weaker. And we're able to secure this higher here. We can secure it hand to the ground. We can flee our elbow here. Spencer's trying to turn back in. He's trying to recover the position here. Very, very difficult. If we face heads this way, we can also grab the fight here. And we can pull that down. Just like we would with a cross-face. And now Spencer's trying to live. Very, very difficult here. We've taken a strong grip. So then to clear this position, going to require a lot of energy. So sometimes here, we almost don't want things too perfect. If Spencer's just dead in the water here, he's likely not going to try to escape. We almost want to give him a little bit of false hope there. I want Spencer to be making a couple of big attempts. Every time he makes a big attempt, he burns energy. Every time he makes a big attempt, then he doesn't get out. He starts to become more concerned, more fit to eat here. So it's another little concept, another little game that can play. It's like, you want them to have hope. You want to take it away. You don't want them to not have hope. So we want them to believe they can fight out of these pin positions. But really not be able to fight out of these pin positions. So to summarize it again, right? Key details here. Aggressively threaten the cross-face. They react. They react. You're taking out a hood. We try to go elbow to elbow. Elbow to elbow is going to be a weak position for them to try to overpower here. And again, you measure the success of the near side of the hood to weather Spencer can turn back in. If he can turn in, let's say we're doing it incorrectly. It's ineffective, really. So really, these things are super simple. No one. People just don't take the time to practice the subtleties of these positions here. We only test things in a row. But we can test these things well, darling. We just secure the position. If they can't turn in, we know we have an effective underwear here. And then obviously we can start to head further down the rabbit hole. Or we can start to give Spencer slightly different positions. See what you can draw in. Or really, focus on the concept. Elbow to elbow. Pin. They can't turn in. You can see, has Spencer tries to move here. He's basically inviting us to pass it. If Spencer's pins, he has to take bigger and bigger wrist to try to find his way to position. Look at this. Go back to this though. Matt, you go back to where you look. You're going to hit that. You turn them in. Spencer's tried to get out. He's basically giving us now. You find a lot of these things happen with effective pins. Someone can't move. Start to panic. They might bad decisions. They give us the passes. These are things you can't really teach. You can't teach this in a linear step-by-step process. We shut down movement. They can't move in traditional ways. They take big wrist. They give us good positions. But again, knee side under hook is my favorite position. I'm going to show you why, right? If Mattie has a cross face. And Spencer has good frames here. I want him to connect these thumbs under this armpit. Thumb to thumb. I want him to place a half butterfly hook. And now I want him to use the half butterfly hook. So put these places on the ground. To elevate Mattie to your right and clear the cross face. Sorry to your left. Come back. Clear to your left. Extend the butterfly hook out. We can clear the cross face, right? We can shrug down the right. Super common escape to the cross face. If Mattie has a knee side under hook. And you try the same things, Spencer. Place the butterfly hook and give him the butterfly hook. And give him the butterfly hook. Much, much stronger pinch position. Just to control us that right. So cross face. Oh, butterfly was your perfect cross face. Still going to be difficult to do that. But he has a means of escaping it. Scabbing it potentially straight to our legs. Knees side under hook. Much more effective pin. We've eliminated this arm. They can't frame with that inside arm. So again, that to me is why it moves more towards the near side of the hook. Because people are able to beat my cross faces with annoying half butterfly god style games. So we covered knee side under hook. Let's do the best in details for the far side under hook. So obviously, we're just going to isolate down the far side under hook. We can do this to pin even from side control. Even on a big fan of side control, right? But if Matt is on top and he secures the far side under hook. So again, Matt secures the under hook to the far side. Knees side would be same side as his hips. Same side as the half god tripe. So if Matt just pulls the under hook to him, Spencer can still probably use his left arm to bridge into Matt's head to make a bit of space here. Whether it's in the shoulder or whether you take it a little higher, Spencer like boss head to face. And now we come back and you can bridge here. Make some space here, right? So again, if we just focus on that, obviously if we combine the cross face with a shallow far side under hook, we're still going to have pretty effective pins here, right? But I want Matt to pull the under hook and place his shoulder on the ground above it. Now, no matter how much Spencer freaks out, it's going to be a super, super powerful pinhead. So again, under hook pulled to you, you place your shoulder over the top. That's going to elevate that shoulder and it's going to kill that bridge here. So now, again, one more time, freaks out, Spencer. Once you secure the pin, super difficult to deal with here. Now we're going to flip it. I want you guys to see that despite Spencer being three foot, seven hundred pounds, it's going to be just as effective for both of them here. So let's really let Spencer practice setting it up. Spencer secured his flat side under hook. Just take a shallow under hook, pull it and place your shoulder to the ground above. So now, I want you to freak out, Matt, see if you can get up. She's crushed. So you can see guys, that's enough. So you guys can see that obviously this great works, even with a massive size, this graph and see you. Alright guys, so let's see sort of loosely how you piece it all together. I want you to understand lower half control, I want you to understand that. Upper half control, and I want you to kind of improvise. You go up the tools and you're going to have to take opportunities as they present themselves, right? We have a shitty half god. They're just going to bring me back inside and we're back to square water. That's it, again, that's a lot of people think half god's just a weird intermediary position. We're that failed to pass the guard or the bottom guy maybe was under mount. They hit an elbow scale and you're like, \"Fuck on lost, the good position, now back to square one.\" I want you to think about it primarily a pin position. The best tool to have to prevent someone standing up. This is the best tool we can have, half god's talk. So Matt's going to take any form of leg tug on the lower control. Spensive fuels this leg tug and get improvised. Use any of the ones we use today. Spensive fuels this, he recognizes, \"I can't use my legs to escape like I traditionally did.\" I'm going to have to have more reliance on the upper body. This is a common reaction, pushing, trying to create space. Now, we see this as an opportunity. We have space, we have space, we can solve the confrontal hooks. Clear, we're flattening them out. Matt is elected for a knee-side under the gear. He pulls in and we go to good pin position. Now we've combined low body control, upper body control. Be as patient as possible here. If someone's freaking out and they're high energy, we meet that with pinning pressure. We don't meet spas energy with our own spas passing attempts. That's how we create space here. And again, on the other flip the coin, if they're being really slow and really disciplined here, doesn't mean we rush. A lot of times, guys will use slow, relaxed movements here, so that when we ever commit, they quickly get a guard back in place. So again, we need to be slow, crushing pressure no matter what here. First priority, they can't move. They can't move and let's say, sort of, very small or they're attempting big movements here. You can see low body control, upper body control. Now Matt can be pretty disciplined here. I want you to point both your heads this way and send the same position. Matt, he's got the knee-side under. He's got the head pin here. He's got the legs control here. Now he can slowly start to work his way up the body. He's stuck his own butterfly hook from top. Maintaining, pealing pressure the whole time. He's not rushing to mount here. He can easily control it here. Let's try a different hook. Just like this one. No, that's fine, that's fine here. So again, guys, we are primarily now you understand the lower body Turks. Matt selected to do the kind of low down top point here. He doesn't have an upper body pin yet. He spends his elbows on tight discipline. He spends his trying to use flames to get out of here. That's allowed us to choose any form of upper body being the presence of someone. Any form of upper body pin. Matt is gone far side under her. So you can see, Spencer cannot bridge in either direction. He's got very little power to do it. As he over commits to these bridges, these legs aren't being disciplined. Where I would progress up the body. I want you to think about this way of passing off God as we control him and we slowly pass. The only time fast passes present themselves to us. I went these guys are trying to move so much today leave massive openings. And again, they will. This happens to good guys happen to highlight black belts. You pin them. They can't move in any direction. They will present you fast passes. Spence of some of these pin positions. Spencer would rather be under Mount than completely flattened out here. The reason I say this is when Matt's in Mount. We can at least use our legs now. We can at least do big movements with our legs. We might have feel more comfortable keeping. But to get out of these pin positions here. When we go good turk on the lower body, good upper body pin. And we're patient here. There's not a lot worse than this. You can't do anything. Often even really good guys will concede. Bosses here. Hoping that they can now at least use their legs again. So guys, this is sort of what I want you to practice with training buttons here. I want you to begin by sort of static drilling here. So Matt chooses a perfect turk. He establishes that. He allows Spencer to take some frames with the upper body. He flats those frames and secures an upper body grip. And then he just deals with Spencer trying to escape. But first, Spencer started about 10%. Then he just slowly builds his way up. Again, primary goal is controlling pin. And if you see the situation here, Spencer's using an awful lot more energy than Matt. And he's getting nowhere. So we're practicing pinning with resistance. And you just look what we've ended up. That could step to mount anytime you want. I want you to practice it like this. Start it, slide resistance, more and more resistance. And then obviously ultimately get into try to find it in live roles. Try to find force half got in live roles. But again, something I like to do with these sort of things is we go back into the position. I try to get my training button to do sort of uneducated escapes. And what do I mean by that? I mean just like trying to bridge, trying to move, but not really trying to think too technically. So we get our pins, we get our turks. Spencer just tries to freak out. Again, not a very educated response, but it allows us to practice our pins. When we feel quite good with that. Now we go back to the stop position with our good pins. A good turk and a good pin in place. And now I say hey, now I want you to escape. But obviously you don't need a freak out like that. I want you to try to find holes in how I'm controlling and still be recognized any weaknesses. So that way I get put into dressing both physical, crazy sort of responses and technical responses. So now I take these grips and spend to try to think about a way out. See he's been this one. He's trying to use a undertook. And that's how it would be more reactive with these positions here. And this is how we get good at these positions, right? This is how I want it. Like if you're the best guy in the gym, you can just force people into these positions and let them give you these responses. Well, obviously if you're not one of the better guys in the positions and you have trouble forcing things within a rolling environment, this is how you work these positions. So again, we've isolated the turks. I say the upper body pins. Now it's up to us. If you're going to have we put them together based on our opponent's reactions, our training bonus reactions. And of course those will be different all across the world. But a lot of things will be the same. So these pins and turks will work in any context where you're done. Little bonus one here. Because obviously what we've done is sort of an MMA wrestling ADCC, saw a grappling context. Built on the presumption that we're securing half god out of wrestling scrambles, rather than out of positions where they're playing suit buying god, open god. But I want this to apply broadly. And again, every gym is going to have god plays, right? That's going to be forever, right? We can force half god out of a hand on hip-tory undone. And when I approach good, open god plays, this is my go-to to force half god. Again, you get someone half god. Flexibility's gone, leg ups are gone. Most things are gone for that position. So we try to force that as a pin. So we create a slight angle here. The square on hand on hip-tory undone really what? So we create an angle. Matt falls to a hip, we stop here, right? Matt is full into an inside hip here, right? And we start applying the hand on hip-tory undone. He details our right elbow is pushing and stretching and growing up on hip. Our hips close to our hands so they can't throw in the last suit. If our hips do fire away, that's going to come in. So we're going to keep our hand close. We're driving off the balls of our feet, we're really forcing trying to force Matt to basically he's hip to come to me at this angle here, right? Everyone has the same reaction here, right? Obviously, we only get our god's boss, that's a built-in reaction. So they start to extend that lower leg and try to catch your leg. Because they don't do that. We don't like that we can end up in side control. And again, instinct your reaction, we don't want to be there, right? So when Matt extends that leg and catches it, he does that because there's something blocking us from a aggressive straight to side control. It's something that attaches him to us. But you can see there's a huge opening here. So what we want to do is we want to now run them so they're flat on their back and that lower leg straight. And we dive forward into a half-god here. And obviously you can see the positioning here. Matt's landed in a pretty bad half-god position. Let's go ahead and straighten this way. Stand the same spot. Matt's landed a bad half-god position. Why is that? He's flat on his back. We're able to elevate the inside leg. And generally speaking, we land in such a way that Matt's slightly facing to his left. Which gives us the knee inside under him. He gives us a solid, solid control position here. So we're not like we forced a half-god with forced a very advantageous off-god. And again, now we're good to scramble here. And again, this is where improvisation is so important here. He's got a good turk on the lower body. You can see where the size of the scap is here. That knee inside underhood might not work too good for him. But if Matt fights his way out of him, he's fighting himself straight into a crossface here. And he's got a very strong crossface here. He's able to use the crossface to pull his head closer to his hips to shorten the size of the scap and see. And he's already locked and loaded. Switching from a turk with his right foot, to basically a butterfly hook or a stable with his other hook. And he can see his progressing straight to mount here. Let's do it one more time. We're approaching the open-god here. Matt's super. Don't go for a hand on hip-tory under here. Create a slight angle. Start to walk. You see, Matt, full of the inside hip. That gives us an opening here. Driving off the bulls about feet, trying to stretch their groin. They're reaching to block a hand on hip-tory under the second trial. We take advantage of that by keeping that leg. Diving ourselves into a half-god. We've already got a link to it. We've got a opening for an inside underhood. But again, size the scap into here. The inside underhood's not working well. We grab that crossface. We pull it to life. And you can see an hour in great position to stop progressing up the body. So again, half-god. Not just that little wrestling pinning environment. You can also find uses for in pure judicious mission-graphing environment. Let's do the best of some submissions now. Two in particular. That are both pins and submissions. So what I mean by that is, we maintain top position. We maintain a strong pinning pressure as we apply the submission. Obviously there's a lot of submissions. We're optimistic. The potential end up on the bottom. Obviously you can potentially scramble out by the end up standing. Obviously there's a time in a place for those. And I think that's usually towards the late part of a round. Late part of a match. When obviously we risk less to lose the position we have. But I think these two submissions, I'm trying to ignore self. If it's crucial, we remain on top. These are highest percentage low risk submission. So we're going to begin with the arm triangle next. So we're going to start with the arm triangle. And we're going to talk about what I believe most people have been told to do the arm triangle completely wrong. The traditional method to finish arm triangle is to step off the body. And when we step off the body, we lose our ability to pin the training partner. And there are very famous examples. One of the most recent was Glova to share and Yuri Pahasca in that fight. Glova set up an arm triangle. Step off the body removes what's holding Yuri down. Yuri hits a backwards well. Scramble's out. I was able to supply this mission attempt. Going back I remember. Another famous one was Iminaria. I'm a young kid. I forget his name. When he came back to us, put him in a deep deep arm triangle. Even now, he backwards rolled out. And actually changed straight into a leg like attack and submitted the kid. So again, I never recommend stepping off the body for an arm triangle. People are talking about doing the clock movement. So let's hear into the suspense. He's going to get a show to you. This is what I mean. A lot of people teach securing arm triangle in amounts, half god whatever. And they took about finishing by stepping off the body. Spirling down, starting to walk like a clock to cut that angle to finish the submission. Of course it works. But in these positions, we have a good chance. We have a good chance to scramble out of this position. And I'm going to show you some techniques of what we can finish the arm triangle. Without risking losing position like this, right? So again, most people have been taught the arm triangle this way. And again, this is wrong. And I'm going to use Spencer to demonstrate why I personally believe this is wrong. And again, that's because we did scramble up. In this position here, Spencer can bring both knees to his chest if. So obviously, you've seen some escapes like this with guys who like grab their leg. Forget about that bullshit. I'm not a fan of anything that just helps us survive. If we're in trouble, we shouldn't be trying to survive. We should be trying to survive. We should be trying to survive. And that's just holding in the position. Spencer brings both knees to his chest. What he's going to be doing with his left arm is going to be framing it and trying to make some space here. Because of course, it's our own shoulder that's choking us here. The tighter that it's in, the worse it's going to be for us. So we're trying to make as much space as we can. Obviously, we're not going to be able to make a ton of space here without changing this movement. So we're going to, at the same time. So Spencer, don't do this until I explain both. We're going to swing our legs wide. So our left leg's going to come hard as if we're turning to total. And our right leg's going to be underneath that leg. At the same time, we do that. We're going to turn this thumb here, the thumb that's in the choke. We're going to try and throw it in their far pocket here. So we do these two movements at the same time. It allows us to stop climbing for total. And it really stresses that grip here. Again, people are going to let go here. And we're going to scramble up to a total position. We're essentially doing what we ordinarily do to get into a total, but we're changing the angle here. And if we come back into this position here, it is key that Spencer turns his thumb towards the hippie. And I want to demonstrate this by showing it incorrectly. If Matt holds on the time and Spencer just tries to get up, with his thumb pointing in the same direction you want to total, very, very tough. We need it basically. It's almost like we're doing a limp on here. And that really helps us open and show our stress and grip. So I think when you guys drill this, you just try it both ways. A lot of people didn't encounter a lot of an arm triangle. Because the trap job is actually, it's inhibiting our movement here. We need to turn our thumb and turn our entire body away. So one more time here. So let's look at the situation. It would occur, so step to mount the starting now. And let's have both of your heads face to the right. Keep going, keep going, keep going. Alright, so we're here. Spencer's going to do the escape and Matt's going to finish it in the traditional way. He's going to try to finish the traditional way, stepping off the body here. He starts to get up. Go back to the exact same starting position. So again, just to show why I stepping off the body is so important here. If Matt maintains this position, obviously there's a step off the body. Spencer can't do this escape, he's hipster control. He can't total from this position. But he waits, and the second Matt steps off the body. He gets to go to the top. He starts to slam it up to a total position here. So that's exactly why I think stepping off the body to finish the arm triangle. It's a weak pin and a weak finish because we relinquish total control of the hips. And of course the lower half is the most powerful part of our body. And if they use that momentum correctly, combined with the correct movement of the trapped arm. We'll be at a stress there, grip it off, be at a total out and survive the submission attempt. Let's talk about the perfect finish for the arm triangle here. Again, I mean perfect finish. Obviously the other one works, the traditional one works. But it comes at a risk of losing position. Let's talk about a few factors that really help arm triangles here. If we're in mount and we do the classic finger walk up, we're under and under her key, we do this classic one. We walk there arm across, maybe they bring it across. This works, but it takes quite a bit of finesse here. I think the best arm triangles are when guys make any sort of bridging movement here. And we can catch them with this shoulder up slightly. In a perfect world, we want that shoulder up. And this is even true if Matt what a step is right like back to a half god here. Say we're working on our pinning position here and they make a big bridging attempt here and we catch it here. This is perfect, right? And why this is perfect? Because when there's shoulders of the ground, it allows us to feed our left arm as deep as possible here. So Matt's securing the back of the armpits on a shoulder area here as reinforced, he's holding it in position. If you want to get that on DP can use his right hand to push the back of Spencer's head. And what he wants to do is he wants to glue the side of his head, the temple, to Spencer's temple here. If there's any space here, Spencer retracts his arm. Exactly, it could come back that way or it could even just follow here because here, Terrible spots of finisher on front. We want this as deep as possible. If Matt steps back to mount here, something else that helps us bring him up on the side is we draw that right knee into that spine here. We're putting something beneath that back and it makes it hard for Spencer to flatten back out. When we go for the finish, we want him to flatten back out, but we want to be in total control of when we allow them to flatten themselves back out. We've got this super tight. So again, the choking arm is as deep as possible. A temple to temple, and if we ever need to get it deeper, we use this hand to push the head. And every time we make it deeper, we reattach to their armpit here so they cannot wiggle around and loosen it. Now we're going to start switching to a palm to palm grip it. We're going to go the choking arm, palm down. And if you look at my arm here, if it's palm up, the choking arm is a ton of space. If it goes palm down, that space gets taken away. So it would work even for someone like Spencer with tiny biceps. So that detail would be much, much more important for personal expense, right? So we hit that palm to palm. Now we're going to apply a similar sprawling pressure. We're going to apply a type of pressure that works just like the clockwork step off, sort of technique, right? We're going to pull their body down a bit. They get, we're pulling them towards our hips. We're going to elevate both our hips widely. And the side we're going to choke them on, we're going to try to touch that hips of a floor. And here is where we get the same finishing pressure without losing, without losing position at stepping off center here. So Matt starts to apply a bit of bicep pressure here, we get this half here. I want you to watch from the mat's legs. So if Matt faces the wall here behind us there, I want you to watch his leg position as he hits this bro. So it locks it up, everything's perfect to get in here. Matt lifts his hips and the same side hip here, drops to the floor. And all he needs to do to finish is a very slight bicep squeeze with his choking arm in. So 10 around face the camera down. So we go isolated down to two things. There's a whole bunch of steps with the upper body. And that's simply a hip sprule on the same side of the entripe. And that finishes it just as quick without compromising position at all. So again, we're in the mount here. We want to pull them up onto this side a little bit. We want to GMMME into this spot. That prevents them falling flat to that back too early here. We're in this position here. So we want to feed out choking arm as deep as possible. So we push that head in. We stay temple to temple to reduce the likelihood of bringing their arm back or out during the fun. Yeah. Spend to trying to bring his arm back here. You can see it's quite stuck. If we were to leave any space there, no. That's going to come back in super annoying here, right? So we've got that trapped in. We're going to go palm to palm again, choking on, palm down. Very important palm down here. I don't want you squeezing your arms and fatiguing yourself here. I want you to apply the appropriate tension because it's our following body weight. It's going to allow us to get this submission. And that's going to allow us to hold this as long as necessary. If we squeeze the side as we can, we'll probably still get up. This is a good chance we're going to fatigue ourselves along the way. And there's also the possibility that they will tap saying their neck hurts, rather than us choking them right. Most of the time in neck crank boot shows you as well. But it hurts so much, you're really only thinking about the neck crank. And the last thing you want is an asshole training partner telling you that that was on the neck. And it wasn't a real chug. Those assholes are the worst people. So we want to prevent that by applying slowly. Also, when we apply submission slowly, first of all, it's safer. But you increase the likelihood that they're going to go to sleep because they're not going to know the submissions on. And we get a ton of bragging, right? Obviously, safely put someone on a sleep rack. Again, you squeeze the sip bar, they're going to tap straight away, the training environment here. Matt slipped it up, everything's perfect. He's got the palm top palm here. He is going to elevate his hips. And the same side as the choke, he's going to collapse, same to the floor, slide his knee back. And now here, he just gently squeezes the bicep here. And we get this submission there. Again, that is the correct way I believe it's a finishing arm triangle from this position. I'm going to throw this one in at the end because this quite often is what happens, right? If Matt's in the arm triangle position here, let's face two heads this way here. Keep going, keep going, keep going. What happened in this position, this is sometimes where I'll choose to go to a half guard position, right? Matt starts hitting this up, and he goes for the same submission. And he throws his hip here. Some guys don't apply this submission. Some guys will use their free arm to try to push this leg over both legs. Come back, come back, push your leg over both to clear it. And then to the trisha, they escape, we did it this way. So some guys will recognize that that is the path to escape is total, right? So go back in the same spot. And jump back in the arm triangle, head facing the same direction. So get so we set this up perfect, we're in mount here, and we lock it up. We collapse out the same side hip here. Spencer might be thinking, stop, stop, stop. Spencer might be thinking, oh, he's got to step off, but he doesn't. So Spencer goes, oh, well, that's my escape. So I'm going to try and drop both my legs to the floor and push that leg off. And now we can do that escape again, right? Come back as that man. So when I'm in mount situation here, the way we beat this. Because again, this arm is completely free. We're not nothing to control our hands, the pre-occupied by the choke. Obviously, our legs are pre-occupied by the attempted pin. So when they start to push on my leg, I make sure I hook a half guard with and across my feet here, and I'll stay heavy here, right? What this does is just like we did with the leg Turks. Spencer's knee is stuck facing me here. If he tries to turtle, he can't turtle. And we can easily start applying the same biceps, go easy again, to get that short. So again, half guard's doing excellent position to finish this from. Because Spencer stays down, just like we were discussing with the Turks. If he's knee is pointed this way, tries to turtle, he can't turtle. But obviously, we step off body here, he can hit that turtle escape. And again, say we're in mount, he clears this foot, he can turtle. So by controlling the diagonal leg and keeping this facing away from the turtle, he won't be at a turtle from this position. So again, correct way to finish is never to exit now. If that spawn and they're aware of the turtle's style escape, just sort of stress out grip, they start applying with that spare foot. We absolutely hook it in a half guard. You could immediately go to the half guard, but I'm not a big fan of adding steps as they're not needed. If we're going to finish it from now, why add this step? If they know what we're up to, add this step to secure the half guard and we'll finish that out of triangle. Very energy, efficiently, and with a pin in mind.",

        "text": "Welcome guys, this product is code just stand up, kind of Derek Lewis inspired, and I'm going to try to explain why the, uh, having the ability to just stand up, really kills a lot of jiu-jitsu and it took me about 15 years to figure this out. But to help me in this product, I found the two ugliest people in the gym. I'm trying to make myself look better by comparison, we got Maddie Clark, and Spencer Spencer is the third Ryan sibling. He is the little sister of the famous brothers, right? Guys, but this product again is going to focus on basically the premise of why a jiu-jitsu doesn't work in the MMA roll set. It's going to be a technical sort of analysis, and it's also going to take into account some rules, considerations, or the rules of MMA, definitely don't favor jiu-jitsu. They favor wrestling a little people on the stand is, but I want to break down technically why wrestling looks so good in a sense of being able to turtle and stand up in an MMA roll set, and why a lot of the skills MMA fighters have, and obviously, wrestlers will still work very well in a jiu-jitsu setting. Having the ability to stand up and shake guys off strip grips is very, very effective in a pure grappling environment as well. So again, you guys might want to make a good recent example, Charles Olivera obviously got submitted by Islam. Everyone looks at that because, oh, the jiu-jitsu guy gets submitted by a sort of sandboat, wrestler base, but there's tons of examples throughout of guys that they're just really good at shaking better grapplers off them, killing gas to them. Obviously, Derek Lewis, super, super famous for this. Another one, sort of unknown one you guys should definitely watch, Ian Harnish, crazy scrambling abilities. And they're using more wrestling techniques to beat jiu-jitsu guys than they are obviously using jiu-jitsu techniques to beat jiu-jitsu guys. I'm going to try to outline why the basic jiu-jitsu methodology of the bottom game is sort of a way to pin yourself. Jiu-jitsu always wants you to keep your opponent between your legs, whether that's a half-god, a close-god, or even a butterfly-god. That's their natural, sort of defensive position. But keeping someone between your legs keeps you pinned to the ground, going to the days of a technical stand-up. Technical stand-up works great if someone keeps distance from me. No one keeps distance from people anymore. If they have any fear at all, you're going to try to stand up. They're going to close the distance, so close the technical stand-up is gone. Jiu-jitsu also discourages, totally. And totally is really the only way you were going to get up off the ground. Obviously, we could use a submission, we could use a sweep. Those are really low percentage compared to circling to stand-up. So circling in a jiu-jitsu context, up to a referee's position, stripping grips, creating scramble out of those positions, even shaking guys off when they have one. Look, even if they use a power half, they're really safe strategies to get up from these positions. So to get jiu-jitsu discourages, you from circling, really, they always talk about back exposure, don't provide back exposure to your training plan to your opponents, but they're great. There are times when back exposure is your only way to get up off the ground. So we can't just roll that out. Another problem Jiu-jitsu has is they want to encourage back exposure. So quite often you'll see guys talk about, we're going to pass the cycle control, we're going to leave the guy space too turtle and we're going to jump on their back. I think that is low low percentage against guys that are good in the turtle position, which a lot of people haven't dealt with because, again, most Jiu-jitsu skills discourage the turtle game altogether. Just look at Eduardo Teller's career, I'd be Jiu-jitsu based on the the way points work, wouldn't reward him for reversals from turtle. He wasn't rewarded for it, and again, the sports to do to context, if something's not rewarded, most gyms, even if they aren't competition focus, sort of loosely move in that direction, right? So again, another example of rules guiding the sport, and again, what Jiu-jitsu was moved in a direction away from sort of that MMA style grappling with shaking people off again. So I'm going to go through this a more detail in the introduction to sort of demonstrate these principles, but again, I just want to remember, Jiu-jitsu's defensive God play is a way to pin yourself, wrestling, turtle, referees position stand up, although seems risky is really your only path to standing up from the bottom position. Alright, so let's put some more detail into what I mean when I say Jiu-jitsu teaches you how to pin yourself, right? So again, if you look at say Matty's hit a double leg with hit this position here, he's on top, the natural Jiu-jitsu response would be to use that legs defensively, and that is to start bringing our legs back in between us and our opponent here, right? And that might involve getting a half-body as sneaking in a half-body, half a god, so obviously he's half way to having a full god again, the god considered defensive position, and he might even try to bring this knee back in to get both legs back in from and to play out of the closed god position. But if Matty stays heavy here on the hips and now Spencer's trying to get up, no chance he's going to get up out of this position, same from if we go back to half god here, if Matty uses let's face both hands this way around, if Matty controls this bottom leg and Spencer can't retract this leg, he stay heavy on the hips, he's never going to be able to get up from these positions here, so Jiu-jitsu teaches you an instinctual response that pins yourself. So if we think about that in an MMA sports specific ruleset, if we stay on bottom of the hole around, we'll then eluce, so when MMA fight is might hit a double to side control, and Jiu-jitsu guys puts it back into a god position, they are pinning themselves and basically causing them to be held in this position the whole time. You might find examples, guys like Charles Olivera, where he will have such an offensive god from bottom, he scares opponents or he threatens the mission tonight back up, that's not the norm here, that's super super high level when Jiu-jitsu. So again I want you to think about this, right? You'll see, say, Matty's in half god here, you'll see guys like Kelvin Gaston, you'll even see guys like if you watched the Israel out of Seniors vs. Yandla Hoelidge fire, right? He is he left his legs on-crossed it, he left him on-crossed, Kelvin will let guys pass, when Kelvin fought Rubber Whittaker, Whittaker could hold him down while he was in half god, but the second he started progressing to a side control here, he just gave up the side control, Kelvin would turtle get up, shaking off straight away, right? So again remember the half god primarily is a pin position and you will not get up from half god. Obviously, we talk about a offensive half god where we secure the under, under that we get up off our back, we start to hit that outside of the coast so that we can start to climb up, that's in a totally different thing. That's he's won many, many battles within that position, but from the most part when we, when we sit in half god, talk to us and we control the bottom leg, we control the hips and prevent the hips moving away, it's very, very difficult to get out of these positions. So obviously I want you to think about this, I want you to drill this with your training bonus here, right? Because what I'm saying, a lot of people instinctually not want to believe, they look at your kids as the B-yendo of ground grappling in whatever role set, because again back in the day, obviously early UFC's and stuff, this is the most effective form of martial arts. But with your training partners at home, I want you to tell the top guy to always be heavy on the inside leg from half god, and to be heavy on the hips and clothes god, and just see if you can get up. I'm pretty sure unless you're training partners are absolutely awful, you will not be able to get up from these positions. But again, I want you to experiment with it, feel it for yourself, and that will help you understand why these positions are self-limiting if our goal is to get back up. A another bad habit for a sort of pinning environment here is how jujitsu will reward god passes two second show, right? So let's say Matt is in half god here. Obviously best case scenario would be for Matt to pass this position to Mount. However he uses that right, he progresses to Mount. He keeps control of the Spencer's hips here by being heavy on the hips, and he can keep some upper body weight, Spencer's upper body here, flattening out the shoulders, facing chest to chest pressure here. That's perfect. I totally encourage that for most of my students always recommend full-sa-half god to progress them out, but never progress to second show. I believe rewarding passes a second show has given us bad habits. Another example here, if Matt hits a knee god here, and he passes a second show, we might hold him in a jujitsu setting for the three seconds that would secure us points. But even in a split jujitsu setting, when we land in second show, more often than not, we get the pass points. But the bottom guy brings his knee back in and starts secure in a dot again. So it becomes this loop where we pass the side. We hold it long enough to secure it, because a lot of the time the second we make any grip adjustment would give him space here. But then again, in another way to look at this, and the reason why a lot of wrestlers in MMA guys don't want to keep you between the legs is because you can see Matt is control him. He's got a cross face. So it's going to be hard for us the bottom-class Spencer here to turn in, right? And Matt is got a far hip control. He's elbows on the hips. This is a breeding decent pin, but you don't have really any control of a Spencer's legs. Spencer can power out of this and aggressively turn this way. And now we have a game where Matt is trying to chase back control here, right? So again, the perfect setting, when we're pinning someone, they don't get to make any movements. They might start making small movements that lead to bigger ones. But in this side control position here, it's actually quite easy from that. Sorry, Spencer to take that risk in turn to turn it over here. And again, a lot of your coaches, a lot of people will say it's easy to take the back. You sort of pass the side, cross face blocks and turning in to get an offensive sort of bottom game back. But we want him to turn away and we're going to jump on the back. That's much easier said than done. And again, the reason I believe it's so easy in it you're just as shedding is because no one knows what to do from total. They get to turn on there, get scared, and it bests in my role back to God. But again, they encouraged that risky behavior of allowing the bottom-class of total in hoping we can get hooks here. But again, you look at an MMA context, you look at really even in an ADCC context where guys are eye developing better turtle positions. That's a hard hard position to attack. If I would want to take someone's back, I would pass two mounts to come back. So it would pass the mount instead of side control here. We're in charge of the whole time. We're still pinning the whole time. Now the climate elbows up, we can start using the threat of Armstrong to create a slight bridge, and we're completely in control of the back taking position here. We're not allowing Spencer to expose his own back. We're forcing a safe back exposure while keeping legs in control of the body. So just to summarize again, right? Sport students are encourages the side control position. And the side control position I personally believe is actually quite a weak pinning position. There's a reason a lot of the times in a resting environment, if we shoot a double, we'll step over the leg into a half-cup because that's such a strong position. I'm going to show you why later in details about how to control half-cup, how a good half-cup prevents our guy on bottom from total. So just if Matt steps the half-cup in, if Spencer tries to total here, really goes for a really time. So even if we don't have up a body control, we're just having on the leg here, he can't really get his hips off the down here, right? If we come back in one of the second control, he can whip his hips far away and force a total here. So again, a lot of the things we're rewarded for in a push setting actually good contrary to what we need to use to control our opponents here. So again, making your own little sister here, obviously making your own the wrestling is passed on a letter of wrestling habits here. If we think about wrestling, the wrestling contexts are at the goal in wrestling, you can finish a match by pinning your opponent, right? Jiu Jitsu in that wrestling context, again, we're basically pinning ourselves here, my half-guide close-guide, we're putting ourselves in a pin. And again, if you think about wrestling, the goal is to pin that's basically that submission. That's how you finish a match here. Their behaviors when they get taken down are to avoid being pinned at all costs. And you'll see that again, like you say, let's repeat a double here, they're going to always look to have that ratio of turning out to total here, or belling out and staying tied here. And again, another habit from the referees position, if we stop basically referees position total, but up to two hands here, they've got control over why the elbows are one of the hips here, right? referees position, here they learn the skills of stripping grips and building parts, right? And again, they learn the skills of not being matters. And they learn it both ways, obviously, offensively through a map, we're learning about riding it into the ground here, trying to pin them, and then in a defensive setting for this position, they're so good at stripping grips and getting straight-offs. And if you think about a grappling context where we don't want to be on board, right? So again, if you think about MMA, you are going to lose the rounds, if you spend the entire round on board, we need to get back up. And even in say an ADCC context, maybe you've been taking down, maybe God isn't your strong suit here, we just want to get back up so we can continue the action. And along the course of trying to get back up, if our opponent takes risky moves, like diving when our back, they might fall off the top, we might be able to shake them off, if they overcome it to these things. You'll see that a lot. I loaded you just to go ahead and stream with MMA fighter and wrestler, and they think again, oh, we're going to dive on his back and throw it hooks, they fool straight over the top end up on board and here, right? So again, wrestling's teaching you how to not be pinned, and it's teaching you how to stand up from a referee's position. A day one wrestler doing his Ejitsu class? Yeah, it is probably pretty likely that if he does these sort of movements, he's going to get his back taken and shut, but it's very easy to fix those defensive wrestling habits that would lead to that to happen, then it is to teach a Jiu-Jitsu guy how to pin guys in that return out of these sort of context here. So again, if you think about it, if I go to get up, Jiu-Jitsu teaches us how to be stuck on our back. If I go to get up, wrestling's really showing you a lot of those habits that are going to lead to us getting up. So again, technical stand-up is never going to work anymore. It's not going to work if someone gives you distance here. If you're on bottom and you want to get up, we have to turtle. We're not going to turtle from close God, we're not going to turtle from half God. We're going to turtle from a psych control position. All right, so we need to completely rethink how we approach the turtle position here. Most Jiu-Jitsu instructors will tell you to never turtle. I'll say, don't turtle, think about risk first reward. Your safest exit, say from a psych control position here, let's go south. They'll say, you should get your guard back and play from here, right? But again, in the context of trying to get up, this might bring our legs back in, but it actually pins ourselves here, right? We're going to get stuck in this position. If we go to a psych control here, they'll say never turtle because of the risk of back exposure. But let's experience that turtle doesn't get his back taken, that he stays behind him. What they'll teach from these positions is to basically roll back to God. These are the two things really they'll say, if you do turtle, roll back to God, and then again, the first one was you're basically low risk bringing these back in and get back to God. But again, both of these situations have led to the same thing. Spencer's got his guard back in, but he's stuck on bottom there. He's not going to get up, right? So again, you need to rethink trying to find yourself in these positions here. So what we're going to try to build is if Spencer goes back to psych control and then turtles, when turtles from here, we're going to rethink this position here. And we're going to rethink basically how risky this position is. A lot of traditional jutsu instructors, who, again, tell you that this is very, very dangerous position to put yourself in, right? But what I'm going to try to show you is how this is actually if done correctly, very hard for your training body as your opponents to attack you out of these positions. They have to win many, many micro battles here. And if we stay disciplined in this position, we can find a path back to the feet from here. Very safe path back to the feet. And again, we're going to use basically things we've stolen from wrestling that you do to guys aren't used to dealing with from here. But we're got, I want you to completely rethink turtle. Obviously, as you start to implement some of these things in your training, you are going to get caught. But that's going to happen with any new part of the game you're trying to work. But I want to argue that whether it's ADCC and especially MMA, if you want to get back up, learning how to be comfortable and safe in turtle is probably the most important skill that you might not have already developed. So the best way to think about changing how we sit in turtle is to sort of reverse engineer what the other party will be doing, what they would be doing offensively to attack out of, right? So if a spence is in a turtle, he's just a regular style turtle here, right? Let's start looking at things Matt would want to do here, right? Say he wants a seatbelt, say he wants double on this, say he wants to start bringing an E inside. That's going to ultimately lead to a hook inside. So if we come back, let's reset everything here, right? So I want you to think how every single thing Matt did them involved space in the hip pocket here. So again, everything Matt wants to do offensively, in some respect is attacking in here. So obviously you're Spencer what a adopt a different posture here. Still, oh, still low here, but he's hiding this space here, his knees are inside, right? So now if Matt starts trying to do anything, he just did. He can't yet, any of those things. There's no space for a seatbelt, there's no space for double on this, there's no space for an E inside here. And let's say Matt's more behind, uh, Spencer. Spencer can even start to climb for hot while still face this way while still protecting that space here. Obviously, if he would have climbed for hot, say he puts his hands on the ground and he lifts his head hot, now he's given Matt a year all the grips, Matt a year long here. There's space for hooks, space for seatbelt, space for double on this body look here. But again, let's say Spencer starts low and he starts to climb for hot. With those elbows inside, a lot of mats and tags are limited here. So that's the first principle I want to get on the stamp in this position. So let's reset it. We want to keep everything super tight here, right? Obviously, this is a perfect turtle. This is a perfect turtle, yeah, face it, sorry. We can't always be so lucky with this position. So if you look at head on, you can see the elbow as a hidden, Spencer faces, man. You can see this space, these protected. Again, this is a perfect turtle situation, right? Often times, introduce it to a big detriment to instruction, as we teach things perfect, but obviously very rarely when we end up in this position. You could pull this at the start of a match and sit it, but in the context of a row, usually they would have won one of those battles and we'll have to start with some sort of detriment. But I want you to drill this with your training body, and just feel that there is a safe way to play turtle here. And we use a value by reverse engineering with the offensive body once. And we know everything they want involves this pocket here. So we can protect that on both sides. We've already put ourselves far ahead in this position to be really strong defensively, and obviously we've got a pathway. Spencer starts to build high. He's keeping those elbows tight to the hip, preventing hooks, preventing any sort of upper body grips. All right, so we've addressed defensive posture with the elbows here, right? And if Spencer goes back into this position here, Spencer's head is low for now, elbows are tight. What we have to also worry about is our feet position here. So you can see Spencer's butt is pretty low over his feet, and his butt is protecting his feet in a sense here, right? If Spencer's butt was in the air here, it was probably actually a more natural position Spencer would find himself in. Matt can start to use his feet here to attack and start to flare Spencer's base it. It's jeopardizing Spencer's base in such a way that Matt might be able to apply enough upper body pressure to even knock him over here. And he's done that because he's fled the leg out. That's compromised. He's basically coming back. So again, when you're playing this, you don't just have to think about this space here. We have to think about their ability to stop flaring our legs here. The more this leg fled, actually the hotter it's going to be to completely protect this space. Because now we can potentially place a hook underneath. Whereas if the butt's hidden here, everything's time, now it's very difficult here. So if Matt's tries to do the same thing here, it's time for him to even attack the feet. So we need to protect the hip pocket, and we need to use that butt to protect our feet. So again, right now we're still in the perfect turtle. We're still in a perfect defensive position here, but it's going to keep us safe from our opponent's easy attacks here. Again, in a typical setting, we want to have everything checked perfectly like this. We'll have one one battle. But here, I just want to understand how if everything's perfect, this is a very hard position to attack, a very frustrating position to attack. And another thing you can see, Spencer's knees aren't too tired together here. Spencer will bring his knees together. We could just tip him over here, right? So Spencer's knees can be squared and he can still protect the hips. So now he's quite structurally down. His feet are protected. The hip pocket's protected here. He's very, very safe in this position. Even though it's a position that traditionally people think he's too high risk to play. Let's try to understand some of the hand fighting situations here that can cool some problems. So Spencer's turtle face in the camera. What will happen is, right, is Matt, if Matt wants to keep Spencer down he's going to keep some weight on top of him here. And he's usually going to have his right hand floating around the hips here. If Matt, say in any circumstances, no matter what Spencer's doing, he leaves any space, that hand's going inside. And it's likely going to try to reach for a one-on-one. Because he pulls that hand back. Now, Spencer's lost the post to try to build hot. He can only build hot with one hand and Matt will likely keep chest pressure forward and it'll be hot for Spencer to get up. So he doesn't have any grips and Spencer's here and he starts to push up. It's going to be much hotter for Matt to drive him for it. So typically speaking, he's going to want at least remove one of these posts here. Because again, Spencer's very structurally strong here. Matt, he has to find a weakness here to keep him for it. So let's go back down here, right? So what we have to be careful of, right, if Matt has a hand on the hip and Spencer wants to clear that grip, when he reaches back, if he flares his elbow, it's going to immediately become a one-on-one here. And now he can use that to drive him for it. So Spencer wants to strip a grip on the hips, obviously one preventative measure to prevent Matt having a very good grip on the hip. Spencer can keep his elbow covering that hip on hip. Now it's hot of a Matt to get a strong grip. And he can slide. So if you look at me here, if you want to strip this grip, I'm going to what was going to come up and I'm going to minimize this space here. So I'm going to reach for the hand here. We're going to reach up and push it down into our back pocket here. So we're sliding back and catching it, pushing it back. Minimizing this space here. We're not going to grab it like this. It's going to be easy to grab it like this, but they're going to be able to take that one-on-one. So we go back there again. Let's say he doesn't incorrectly. Matt finds that space to get a one-on-one. Let's say he does it correctly and Matt's looking for a one-on-one. Very difficult here. Whenever we grab a hand from a position like this too, we actually want to collect and crush the fingers and thumb together here. Now that's super hard for Matt to count on this grip at all. If we grab the wrist here, he can pop a ladder that quick and maybe even secure his own wrist out one-on-one grip. So again, we have to be disciplined here, right? So if I jump in and Matt's behind me here, I might have even built a little bit of height here. So so I would clear this shape. If I want to clear this grip here, I don't reach like this. He immediately takes a one-on-one. I want to cover the hand here and push up behind me here. Now it's hard for Matt to drive me forward. It's often to utilize this grip at all. And I'm still keeping everything projected. But again, a lot of times people will see rest, let me clear this grip and he gets the one-on-one. And if I grab his wrist, here nothing stops him from grabbing my other wrist. If I cover his hand here, now he tries to grab my other hand. Tough. If I grab his wrist, he can grab my wrist. And again, a cross-grip here is super difficult to break. He can run me down quite easy here. Suspensive jumps back here. So obviously another drill I want you guys to practice. It's just been super disciplined here. Try to not give them anything. Try to build a little bit of height and clear that hand. Super difficult for Matt to attack you with anything really. Super frustrating. It allows me to stop building quiet. It's hard for Matt to stay in charge. So play around with that. But obviously again, cover the fingers and thumb to clear a grip and keep your elbows glued to your body if you need a reach for any grips. Because what we don't want is that circular battle where we keep the top guy keeps switching grips off on us. We're never going to get back up if they've got a solid one-on-one or a cross sort of one-on-one post. Again, that's going to keep us in this circular loop. It's going to keep us down in this position. That circular loop would be basically continually trying to retain guard and they pause. We keep getting our guard back, but we're still stuck on board. Alright, these guys have been in this position for the last 45 minutes, so we're going to stick it out from here. So again, Matt is trying to attack you. He's not finding the opening to you. Again, it's super frustrating. It's super frustrating. The offensive guy doesn't work much of this position. Because again, they've been told that if we can make a guy turtle, it's an excellent position. So when you make someone good or position you think's super strong for you, it actually is kind of frustrating. Actually, it's quite often to us making bad decisions from positions like this, right? So if Spencer's goal is to get up in, right? If he can push his hands on the floor, he's starting to do a high super tech in this space. Whatever side, Matt is on, you can see Matt slightly to Spencer's right here. So Spencer's going to want to stand up with his right leg. Because that's the side Maddie would want to throw in a hook. It's the nearest side hook. It's a much bigger movement and it's going to provide much more space for Spencer here if Matt were to try to throw in the left hook. So he has to completely change angles. If Spencer does this in correct and comes back and steps up with his left, there's more space for Matt to start throwing in the right hook. And hang in wait. And again, not the end of the world. We're going to work those positions as well. Even if we do make the error of giving him a hook, again, I don't want you to think he's the end of the world. Doesn't mean we want it to happen here. It adds steps for our progression up. So again, Matt is behind Spencer as usual. Spencer's on his hands. He starts to build high. He steps up with the other leg. He's onto it. And he see it's difficult here. He's pretty structurally sound, right? If Matt tries to run Spencer for that leg allows him to push wait back in, they can even try and push her up a little more here. That's going to be harder for Matt to drive in for it. Even with the leg up if we're completely leaning forward here, Matt can probably run Spencer forward and push it back down. Which might lead to openings as we try to fly up, us going back down here. So when we step up, take a big step forward that allows us to drive wait back. Again, that right leg, that's the hook, Matt wants. Matt's obviously knows it here. He's not going to try to dive up, but it's because we're protecting it here. What Spencer wants to do is he wants to strip this grip on our left hip hip. And again, just like we covered previously, we don't want to leave a ton of space as we do it because if Matt gets a one on one here, it's going to be an annoying trip to deal with here. We're going to potentially be put back down to a lower level. So this elbow glues to our body, and we try to cover the fingers in thumb here. Now as we push that back, we take a big step with the other leg forward. It starts to be right. And you can see here, Matt doesn't really have any strong grips and allows us to turn back in quite easily and even get attention back to offensive positions here. So when we're in this position here, let's say we start fully collapsed. In a perfect world, we feel it hot without making any space. We see that they're on our right side. We see that their preference would be the right hook. So that's the leg we set up. All the while we're protecting that very important elbow space here. This left hand, Matt has here, is a potential pulling grip. He can try to pull spence it back. That's going to be a problem. So we need a strip back grip. We need a strip back grip without conceding too much of this inside space here. And now we can start to climb forward away and turn back in. The reason we really want to try to break those grips right, is because say we get up and Matt secures a body loop. We could potentially be getting lifted and dumped here. Obviously, no one wants to get slams, would you get injured? It's embarrassing. So we really want to attack those grips. And we want to do it in a structurally sound way. And that's going to usually be split legs. If we would have stand up in this position with square legs here, you'll find that you're in quite a vulnerable position for foot sweeps. And another potentially embarrassing thing you're whether it's like that, whether as you go to turn in, you kick the inside leg, this sort of stop, right? What's going to help us beat that is that split stance here? What much more structurally sound is here, right? So when we do strip this grip, we can turn straight back in and take our amount of hook safely here, right? So again, this is something you can do as a solo drill. So if Matt's out of the question in, spence it's your spence is down. He's in the totals, a stop completely down way here. You can practice as a home. Obviously, it's got a look strange, but go for it. Here, we start to do it hard. We're always protecting this space here. We imagine there on one side, we start to step that leg up. We're keeping everything protected, we strip the grip on the hip. We take a big step forward, without a leg. We're structurally standing with pretty solid base-wise and we can start to turn back in. Turning in is what really mitigates some of that foot-sweet risk rather than doing the beat turn out. The bigger the movement, you make sure the more compromised your leg position for position is here, right? So we can turn in, it's a shorter path and again, safer foot-sweeps. We don't want to get slim, we don't want to get foot-sweeps, because again, super highlight real embarrassing stuff. Especially now, Jim, we have the cameras everywhere. So if you get foot-sweeps, you can bet it's going on YouTube. Of course, unless it's one of the coaches then we delete that stuff. Obviously in a perfect world, Spencer's in total, and Matt's on top, Spencer can build this high. Let's say he starts more crunch down and he starts to climb head high here. That's a perfect situation here. That's usually Matt not being disciplined with his weight distribution. Let's say Matt's more behind Spencer here, driving heavy and Spencer can't get up to this position here. He's just chest to back here, driving foot. It's in this context where we would need to use something like a knee slide just to get out from underneath. Again, this is a situation where their weight is here. Spencer tries to build high and he can't get up. Most of it's a guy who be sitting a little further back hoping to throw hooks as we build high. But again, a lot of times if I think it can pin here, I think it can throw here. So if I jump in, if I can get up even as a solar person here, I'm here trying to build it on. I'm going to have to do a knee slide. Obviously, I can't just step up because we're carrying so much weight. I'm going to slightly lift my leg, post on the ground, knee slide out and come straight up and we get stuck, tripping grip from this position. So again, way here, I can't get up. I slightly lift the knee, post and make some distance here. So it's kind of jump here. So again, Spencer is trying to push you, he can't do it. He's going to slightly lift his right leg. He won't be able to lift it too much because again, there's so much weight on top. Now we're going to knee slide straight out and he's made some space here that has to chase. And now he's in a position we can stop posturing up, stop practice in stripping grips here. He's made space. It's a much better position for Spencer to stop building on it. So again, one more time. He stopped to elevate that outside leg. He slides to make distance basically separates the abs. And now we're in this position again, we can start stripping and standing up, put ourselves in a position. That's much about Chata. It's a control. So again, another drew you can practice by yourself. I would recommend developing the movement and then trying to add resistance to it. So Spencer does it without magic. Spencer could be on, he's practicing, he starts to imagine, he can't get up, he builds that high, creates separation and stop finding the grips of the hips. Again, the context of this is when their weight is so far forward, we cannot start building on it. They're so heavy on top. We have the knee slide to make space. So again, another thing we can steal from wrestling that still works, I'm just obviously you think there's certain things you can't just blatantly steal from wrestling because it's kind of get us choked, it's going to get us submitted, different threats. But there are things like this, we're at safe, he's not leaving any space for hooks, he's not leaving any elbow space, he can safely slide out, make some separation, some separation that allows him to build a head high and start to stand back up. Let's talk about how we could use the Granby, right? But let's start super basic. So obviously the Granby is a tricky move. A lot of people have a lot of trouble with it. Let's be whether they think a forward roll is a Granby, right? So let's start super basic. Granby is something you absolutely have to know. You have to keep it in the back pocket for when you want to develop a total position. Sometimes in Granby you make some separation, you hit it, it's like a get out of jail free car. You can bypass the battle for standing, you can start to build high, Granby is separate that grips, reset the position. So again, you have to have a, because some guys are going to be so strong that when we try to build high, it's super super difficult. Maybe we don't have the energy for it at that point. We've tried to do it too many times. Granby is like a get out of jail free car, right? So Spencer is going to show us how to do this Granby right now. And we all, everyone, I develop a ability to grab a Granby by practicing by myself. It's maybe a good drill to practice when no one else is around, because it is a complicated movement. And if you, you show up the class and people are watching you try to do it, you feel retarded. It actually makes it more difficult, right? So I would try to get them to gym early, or if you have mats at home, practice it, practice it regularly, because again if you do mess it up, you could actually injure it. So I would really want you to be able to do this solo to quite a high standard before you try to pull it out, be it wrong. Because if you try to do it when someone's too locked up on you, you're out of position, you can't really spike yourself, stack yourself on your own neck yet. So the drill I would recommend is this. So just for context, let's see, Spencer does a forward row would be rows over a shoulder and the hips forward the floor again. So again, that's key with a Granby. Now hips transfer overhead. Now hips never get too low to the ground. This is about as low as they're going to get. And he's rolling from one shoulder to the other. And he sits transfer over the head here. So he's some things to think about here. Spencer's up on one leg. He's not two knees to the ground. Two knees to the ground is it's simply he's rolling pressure here. It's going to be on a course of Granby, but it's going to be quite awake. We want a Granby to be locked and locked. We need a driving for you. So one leg really wants to be up because obviously Granby is going to be some resistance from our training bonus potentially our opponent's here. So it's good to have your ability to have one leg up so we can drive through the Granby here. So Spencer's got one leg up. Some people have trouble. Obviously, Spencer's three foot seven here. Very compact. You can roll in any of these positions here. What we can do is something I have to do myself. Spencer faces this with. I'll actually throw my hands behind my back as I transfer shoulder to shoulder here. And we drive through. So Spencer's hitting it nice and smooth here. A little detail you can add that's going to give you a little bit more hip when you finish is we're going to try to hit our hips high at that last second. So obviously a solo drew the way Spencer was doing it was perfect. So let's see that again. Spencer just smoothly rolls from one side to the other. That's what we want to start with. That's the building blocks for this movement. But when we're doing it with resistance, we might need a little bit of explosive energy at the top. So as we drive and Spencer goes from my shoulder to the other, he's going to hit pop these hips as high as possible here. So it's like a little spring at the end. If you're a ghee guy that is watching this, the movement I can most relate it to in the ghee is when you're having a beer ball or a battle and you park your hips in the air to land to side control. So again, I might be way out of that food. You might be a no guillotine guy. But again, that's the movement I think most cause I started my career up into black well the ghee and that's the most movement that relates to this. It's that little heap explosion at the end. So Spencer hates it again. He pops his hips high. That makes it hard to control the hips right. So that's a solo drew. We can do in this position. Again, get comfortable with that before you try it in a row. If there's ever a complicated risky move, make sure you're completely comfortable doing it solo or before you try it with a training partner. You might try and completely injure yourself. Spencer's super smooth with it. He's not getting stuck upside down or anything. If you're having trouble keeping your shoulders compressed and keeping your hips higher, then you need to just practice them all. So you need to really develop the solo drill. Again, before you try and do it in a row. It's complicated movement. It's risky. That's a solo drill to develop the movement. After this, we're going to cover how we can potentially use it from the total position. Let's take a little bit of a grand be in a context of the total sort of system we're doing now, right? So I mistake, I see people make, is they go for a grand be from just here. And obviously, Matt doesn't do anything, it's going to work. But we come back at this particular angle. When Spencer starts to grab, he compromises his face and Matt can easily pull a hip to the floor. And you see this happen a lot, you even see this happen when guys think they're doing a grand be they do a forward row. They just end up in psychiatry. You can just hold their hips to the floor. This isn't even a matter of us having to follow their grand be, which is another skill entirely of its own. You see wrestlers try to grand be in another wrestlers. Follow this out of one, they follow the movement. This isn't that, this is just simply, he's out of position to do the grand be and it gets pulled down, right? A context in which we could use the grand be here would be to combine it with a previous movie tip. And that would be, Spencer begins a knee, the knee slide hit, he makes it in a spacey and grand be. So Matt can't simply pull the hip to the floor because he's busy trying to follow Spencer and stay behind him, creating some separation and using the grand be when opponent doesn't have a lot of hands is the safest time to go for a grand be. You can hit a grand be when a training pot has half a lot of hands around the body but you can get stuck there. You'll much more likely to sustain an injury within a grand be when you're doing it when your opponent has a lot of hands. You can see in this situation because of our strong defensive total grips and there's no opportunity for Matt to look his hands, Matt's just keeping heavy pressure to keep still and, sorry, keep Spencer tall heavy hit and Spencer can start to beat up to make some sacrifices and immediately hit that grand be to the inside of land square. And something to give you guys to say in that exact finish position here, something that quant often happens and the reason why the grand be such useful skill to have is because you go from defensive or offensive very quick. When we grand be successful, Matt was in such a good position. When you're in a really good position and you lose you generally make fast bad decisions to try to recover what you've lost. So if Matt rushes aggressively 40 ends up being shot off and we might have, we might have gone straight behind him and did up behind him it and we lose the position. So again, why I like the grand be so much is because you were in quite a bad position to the perception of the person attacking you and when we hit that grand be, we reverse the smart play from the defender, the attacking now turned defender, we'd be to recognize exhaust the position and approach cautiously. But again, what happens is people are lost such a good position they rush forward and they're actually out of position here allowing us potentially ratio and turn that bad position. Sorry, bad position into a really good position. We flip the script within a five second scramble here. So again, crack the solo, add it to your game, add it to the knee cut, the knee slide here. As you get better out of it, you can attempt to do it when our guys have well can't. So let's say Matt has a look, hands are bad. We can't do it here. We need to do some hot first or even hit a knee cut. We can do it here but I want you to be very, very comfortable at this position. It's a high risk position because look, if Matt's hands don't open here, you're stacking yourself in. That's why I'm really speaking about that power sort of popping movement here because if Spencer hits that, he's hips go over the elbow here because way over the elbow and compromises Matt's scripts here. But again, if you have a very weak scramble, if you have a cramby that doesn't have that pump, you might simply stack yourself in. We need to take out hips over the elbow and on the flip side of that. If you hit a very weak grambi like this and say Matt doesn't know how to correctly respond to that go, you can injure your own training partners as I think that got a good position. They keep the hands connected. We roll over to their elbow. So again, start slow, think of it from a safety context. Not just for you but for your training partners as well.",

        "text": "To you Kamora setups, two of my preferred Kamora setups involving half guard pins. Obviously, we talked about how we set it up from now. I'm a big fan of setting up, I'm trying a lot, further away than you think they're looking for a rat. I think the best time to set it up is like a briefly explained in a bridge, but also I think it's a great time to set it up when they latch onto a kamura group or anything like that. Because their spats are down, and he's in the half guard top here. The initial stage of a kamura, they have to bring the left arm over the top. Obviously, they secure the kamura group. But if you didn't secure the kamura group, that's a perfect arm triangle, it's a matya. So again, obviously this is basically a bridge, he's part of this, I let him lock it up. Now I bring my left knee inside to strip that grip, and then we throw straight as the arm triangle. And again, just like I mentioned previous, it's a really good arm triangle because he's lifted his fast shoulder off the ground. That allows us to get such a perfect five grip in. Let's just see the kamura group breaking up more times. Say away here, they dive over, as soon as they lock it up, I place my knee inside, strip that grip, and throw that cross facing arm triangle pressure group. Super hot. Now we've locked it up here, I do everything the same again, making sure we go to temple to temple. And we can even use our right hand if we feel comfortable removing that post to push into that again. And you can see Matt is setting it up on a diagonal here, it's already a ton of pressure here, quiet often. And you'll be surprised that we come back a couple steps from us doing the half got in. Sometimes, because I've thrown it so deep, I start squeezing, we get a bit of a submission here. And of course, when I say squeeze, I mean activate the choking on bicep, which in this situation would be Maddie Clark's left bicep. That's the only squeeze I want you to do, I don't want you to crush everything together. At body weight, hold things in position, the only squeeze is activated in the bicep. But I start squeezing here, and then I slowly progress the pass. I have progressed the step into now for trapping and immediately pulling to the half got on the opposite side. Ensuring that this leg traps, spence and start naked, as now spence tries to tilt. He's completely pain, so we get to finish here. So we'll do the whole sequence one more time, we'll back in half that here. We're up top, spence it goes, dive up for Camora. We step on the bottom arm, it allows us to rip out grip out, we throw that in super strong. Again, immediately, tempo to tempo, so he's arms isolated against the neck and shoulders going to choke himself. We secure those grips, we pull them down, and we can start to obviously pummel this out on butterfly hook in. All the while, I keep the active squeeze going with my lap bicep. And again, of course, sometimes we do get this to missh it along the way. But Maddy Claus is going to either look to step to now, it's very good finish it. Or we come back to steps, or he steps, and immediately pulls into the opposite half got to the half got in this trap. Here, because spence is neat and spacing away from the direction he had total, very difficult for him to total away and we can get that submission. Another option that looks very similar to this Camora option because of the way they bridge. We're in a half got, we got a great took, and we got a great knee aside under him. And we're flattening spence around. When people can't move, even experience people, they make bad decisions. Most high level guys, most even black belts, and of course, as the technical capability moves down, obviously going to make worse decisions, but you put someone in a position that can ordinarily move in. And if they can't move in it, again, they make rash decisions. Something that happens here, we've got such a good pin on spence's left side. It's hard for him to turn to his left. Sorry, spence is right side. It's hard for him to turn to his left. But he might start to freak out and try to bridge over the left shoulder because the knee aside under doesn't block that. And you can see the way he's bridge here has opened us up to a perfect arm triangle grip. And we can run through the sequence exactly the same as we had done in that previous move. Mount finish, half got finished. So we come back to this half got within the aside under him. So because this knee side under hook is really strong, and it's hard for spence to turn. Two spence is left. Two mats right. But as he's freaking out here, he finds a bit of opening to bridge in. We immediately let go of the knee aside under hook and throw in that clubbing arm triangle grip. And we can use that to start pressureing and finishing in the exact same way. Again, it's super simple, but when you start rolling with pins in lines, one way to beat the pin with other speed to try to bridge, try to just rub the top guys base. Because we, on bottom, feel like he's a static as possible. We need a movement, and everyone's decision is onto a big movement. Obviously, I think the way to get out of these positions is tons of micro movements, forcing the top guys to adjust the flying space. But that takes experience, and most guys get stuck. They think big movement, the only way they can move kind of create a big movement, and there is to bridge in the wrong direction, which leads to us getting out of trouble. All right, let's talk about the second submission. I'm only going to be covered in two. I'm trying to win now in North South. I love North South, because it is primarily a pin position. This position is great, and it comes up a ton more when people are thinking about not being pinned. When you think about a tradition of jujitsu context, we're wasting in hipposcapes, and we're happy to be flat on our back, even with our head touching the ground. North South is still a threat, but it's less likely. But when say, like, Spencer does not want to land with two shoulders fight on the ground at all. He'll quite often lift his head off the ground. He might even land in a seated position like this. Sometimes it's Spencer's and so. Sometimes we might have pulled him over. I'm trying to pull him back and he sits. In these positions, any time he's seated, is a great spot to start. Pulling people in to know what South positions. Even if I somehow landed here in Spencer's sitting off, it's the heads of the ground. We can start during the North South position. In itself, it's obviously a submission. We can't finish from here. But you can see here, Spencer freaks out, trying to escape. It got quite a strong pin position hit. It's hard for Spencer to turn to his left, because my blast set acts as a cross-phase. It's hard for him to turn to his right, because my ribs act as a cross-phase. So, however, you find yourself in these situations. And again, it is very, very common when you deal with the rest. I think North South jokes a much, much more successful when the bottom guy is completely unwilling to accept bottom position. So, this is why I believe in the sort of the tools we've gone over in this instructional. Learning the North South is going to do a lot of good because it's going to be both a pin and a submission threat. And it's going to come up a lot more often in this style of grappling. So, we'll get straight into how to finish the North South chair. Alright, so let's talk about it from the seated context. Again, Spencer's sat on his butt. And now, wherever we ended up here, Spencer might have been turd, we might have pulled him down to his butt and he stayed square here. He's sitting in this position here. We've been able to find an underhook without right on here. So, we've got a right on underhook. That slow Spencer's ability to run to his left. And it allows us to stop pulling in backwards and throwing out choking on over the head. What we do is we first and foremost, we use this as a pin, so we put some weight down on this. You can see here, even before we're even attempting sort of submissions, Spencer cannot easily get out. You can see the weight with landed here, right? So, with landed, with Spencer's chin facing up, his chin isn't underhook. If Spencer was turned in out of position here, we have nothing here. We have no pin because he can turn in, and we obviously have no choice. That's the biggest mistake people make when they're trying to learn North South. They always land rather than here, they land with the guys chin up than it. Terrible terrible control position, choking position, obviously. So, you see what Matt's done very well here is the hip closest to the choke is lower than the other hip, the other hip slightly higher. That allows us to put more weight exactly where it's needed. And that is into the side of Spencer's face to act as a crossface here. If he reverse these hips, there'd be space for Spencer's face to turn in. And we lose our control position here. So, the hip closest to the head is the heavy hip hip. Matt's choking arm, Matt's left arm, is as deep as he can get it here. His elbow is on the ground here. His elbow is not high off the ground, if his elbow is off the ground, it'd be a shallow grip. And obviously again, more space for Spencer to mess with the grip. So, that elbow is firmly planted on the ground. Both using our bicep of that arm as a crossface to limit his ability to turn to his left. And to act as a good base of support that we can put weight onto that elbow here. What we want to do to finish the North South. And I want you to practice it with one hand first of all. This submission is easy to learn with one hand. The second hand is merely a hand assist. Everything's done with the choking arm. That second arm just reinforces the grip. So, without resistance, we should be able to do it with one arm. If you can't do it with one arm, you won't be able to do it with two arms alive in a row. So, we're here. What we want to do is we're going to make slow movements. Matt's going to move backwards. What that does it pulls Spencer's chin up allowing us to get deeper and deeper into the neck here. Because of course, we wouldn't want his chin in the choke here. If his chin was too low, we'd probably suffocate him, but he horrible anyway, honestly, but we're not going to get a clean choke here. So, when we walk down and then across into the head, what we're trying to do is both lift the chin and turn them away from us slightly here. That allows us to collapse out basically the back of our rib cage here into the opposite side of the neck. We always do it in that order. We go back slightly across. Back slightly across. And as we do that, we're trying to drag our choking arm shoulder to the floor on the opposite side of the neck. That puts more weight in the front of our neck here. So, of course, the choking arm bicep attacks one side of the neck. The ribs attack the other side. And as we're heavy with the shoulder, that covers the front of our throat. And in this position, out choking arm is palm down, just like in the arm triangle, palm up leaf space, palm down, removes our space. And Matt, if his positioning is correct, should be out of finish, it would just spicyly squeezing his bicep here. We can squeeze that bicep for quite a while here. We can keep this active. If we squeeze out and tie a body around this, we're going to fatigue ourselves quite quick. For isolating down to one single muscle, we can have a lot more endurance than if a squeezing 10-12, the attain muscles are once here. So, in this position, Matt should be out of finish it with one hand. So, let's start over again, pull him down and catch it. So, we've ended up behind him here, we're trying to pin him. We don't want him to get up and get away. So, we secure the underhook, we start to pull him. As soon as that shoulders full slightly behind the hips, we throw this arm under the top and we immediately throw it right down. We're throwing it in such a position that their chin isn't turned in. Their face isn't under average cage yet. It's next to it. So, again, we did this wrong. Spence his face is underneath. And he can move. We're going to have a cross face on that side. If his face is pointed up, we can catch it deep here. Spence his trying to turn in. The rib cage is blocking it. We have a very effective pin on the shoulders here. Our elbows have to be choked down as plundered and it's as deep as possible here. What we're going to do, we're going to walk backwards. So, just to demonstrate, if Matt just squeeze his face up here, this pressure, but it's not enough to choke. All Matt is going to do is going to slide down towards the head and into the head. And he keeps doing a slight movement like that. And you can see the pressure starts to feel. That's the direction we move to find the choke here, find the strangle if you're that way inclined. That's how we get the submission at this point. First of all, most control. And then we move our body on this side to further get our position so correctly that all we need to do is squeeze the blast out. Now we're going to flip it around so we can see what's going on on this other side there. So we go to the north side. So we've seen what's happening on this side. Now we need to see what happens on this side. This is our hand assist. So this hand is going to connect to our other hand as we get in position here. So Matt is a lot of these hands here while maintaining choking on palm down here. Again, everything he does is with the other this is simply holding a position here. And again, Matt does the same finish. He gets the same squeeze. Obviously our hand started here. They might be able to weasel this arm in. And we're going to have to do a bit of a hand fight. See Matt he brings it over the top strips it away and then throws his hand into position. You can see here Spencer cannot move very easy. So we lock out two hands together. Spencer cannot move. He's stuck in a pin. We got weight on both of his shoulders. And we're able to get it easy to mission it. Obviously we were trying to do one hand with a weight to scrap and see even if he did fight. He's a good chance Matt would still get it here. But for most situations we need this hand to sit. So again, I want you to get good at this little parcel of him. If Spencer starts pushing on the head here, which is annoying, we're going to use our other hand to strip the frame. And then we're free to lock our hands here. It's just a minus step, but this will be the perfect position to lock it up here. Don't want him in. Perfect, don't doubt you. No one sounds parcel of drill, right? So you remember when I was teaching on a South I said, \"We want to catch that chain facing up.\" Sometimes our hips will be out of position and mess it up and move the land and they had to be facing it, right? So obviously, if I was north-southing on this side to my ribs on this side and they'd get that chain underneath, we cannot complete this mission on the same side. But when they turn this way, they're turning into the north-south on the other side. So we're going to show this from a few angles. It's going to be hard to see on the camera, but we'll do our best there. We've got a little person here to help us, but maths sets up the house itself. The knees are down. All right, so again, the chain is up. We're good here. If the chain turns in and maths has to finish here, he's not going to get the finish, right? But what he can do is he can pass it off to the other side. Because it's Spencer looks to kill the north-south on this side. He loads himself into the north-south on the other side. So Matt goes for it here. He brings his weight up. He grabs the back of the hand and he forcefully pushes it. The direction it was going anyway. And we're able to catch it on this side here. So a good little drill you can do. And just so you can see it from this angle, showing other angles as well. Is we land perfectly and then we give ourselves a forced area here where we give Spencer enough space to turn back in. Spencer turns in. Now we pass off to the other side and we do that little hand assist. So let's have Spencer's head face this way. Spencer face his dead. So where you see here is perfect, right? Matt's got complete control. Matt's practice doing a wrap. Now he makes a little space of our Spencer to turn in. You'll see Matt grabs the back of Spencer's head. Forcibly pushes it to the other side. Catches it tight and applies a little bit of pressure here. He knows he's got it. He allows a bit of space. Same thing happens again. And Spencer in this position and natural response for him is at first immediate response. It should be his instinctual response is to try to turn in. And when he does that, you see he's pushing himself in the direction of the other side. It would be a good difference anyway, right? Let's go back to the other side again. Let's say Matt lands here. Let's say Matt doesn't know the pass-off and Spencer in this space. That's what your first reaction should be. The first side of a bad North South is obviously if you can turn in. And now again, of course, that builds the situation with Matt. That's that's that pass-off. So again, super simple drill. But it's an option for when we want to force the North South when we're in a situation where we've made some type of error and that chin's turned in of the D got ribs. Let's have a look at a karate choke technique. And it feeds in very well from the North South position, right? Let's say Matt has a North South setup. And again, we spoke about this hand fight here, right? Obviously the high-end Matt's head is the easier it is for Spencer to be annoying here and mess around here. And we have to keep hand fighting. Let's say someone's real sneaky. Maybe they're real flexible shoulders and they keep sneaking in this hand back inside. What we're going to do here, right, is we're going to basically do a karate choke with the non-shoken hand. We're going to hit that palm up as close as we can as deep as we can to the armpit head. Now, we're going to start to roll them up here. And it's going to put a ton of pressure into that sort of stone in the area here. Matt can do this obviously, again, Spencer's 3-foot 7-12 years old. We've probably got the submission on something like Spencer, right? But really, the purpose of the karate choke is to start transferring to Kamura Stahlgrips where Spencer cannot separate the grip right. So what I mean by that is as we slice it, if Matt lets go in the north cell, here, Spencer's trying to free that arm. It's completely wedged under his body here. If Matt exaggerates his head position a little, so it's trapped, right? So we're trapping it in the side, he's elbow, we're applying pressure to the elbow here and they cannot free this arm. Obviously, it's going to put a bit of pressure on the chest. It's more of a chest compression here. And that's what we can start setting up Kamura Stahlgrips. But it's a way for us to transfer from a failed north south to sort of a shoulder attack here. So look at it again. We're down north south, this guy's been super annoying with the hand, but what he places his hand in this position, he's vulnerable, because he's given us this open space here. So we throw our arm in. Again, for the sake of fun, obviously, you can apply the pressure and start to get a submission. It comes on strangely quicker. But Matt can use that to force Spencer up on to his side while trapping the arm and get a free pass to the Kamura. Now we've got a Kamura position here, right? You guys can do whatever you want with that, right? This isn't a Kamura instructional. I just want you to see the north south feeds well into it. Obviously, in that position, you could go back triangle, anchors and conquer regular Kamura, or even a Tureka plot of here. But I'm going to do it on Spencer once on just by fun. It is, in fact, childhood abuse. So I'm trying to go over the north south. He's being an asshole here, right? We hit the karate chop, and you see how deep my wrist is here. And we already get that submission there. It's incredible to watch his legs wiggle from the position. But of course, what I'm trying to force is this, and we can start, obviously, attacking a bunch of stuff from this position. We could sit back, arm by a back triangle, whatever, right? But again, the purpose is we create a wedge under the arm, inside the space between the elbow and shoulder. And if his elbow is touching his body, he can't clear this position. I'm replacing my body with my hand here, but it's basically the same thing. It's just going to be wanted to see on Kamura from this position. But in the broad context of getting back up, pins, pin escapes, something you have to understand is front headlock. I guess it's somewhat of an offensive aspect. So you're the one in the front head, but I want you to, first of all, realize it's not as dangerous as you think it is. Again, most of you did to guys avoid that total position altogether. Obviously, if they're behind the arms, they're in a traditional turtle. Say, \"You're a punty, you're training punts are in front with a chin shell.\" That's it, that's basically a front headlock position right. A lot of you did to guys, we not only avoid the traditional turtle position, but we don't want to be in the front headlock at all. I want to go over in this section how much safer it is than you think it is. And how it is a great position to reverse the rap. Because if we're comfortable in front head, if our training punts start diving on front head attacks, and we understand where we're safe, quite often they end up on border. I think in high-risk situations, front head attacks too risky. Quite often they end up conceding sweep or take down points. Or quite often, even if we have them, say we've snapped them even from a seated guard position. We come up a little bit, we dive on the head, we end up straight back on border. Everyone thinks they're really, really good at front head attacks, until they deal with someone that's a deep understanding of the position. And then they suddenly find themselves on bottom and they're like, \"Oh, I should have just scrolled out of that tank down the tank there.\" So it is a hard risk, hard reward game. But obviously, the better we understand the position defensively, the more reward will be for us, the less reward will be for the front head attack. So we're going to get into a couple of things here, and you'll see some of these concepts, a very similar to what we did earlier, when we were escaping with the hip position. We were doing elbow drags and shaking them off the top. Basically, I believe it's called basically a wrestling battle roll dump. I want to show you how even with the front headlock position, we can do very similar stuff in an offensive manner. The two things I want you to understand by the end of this will be basically a soccer drag and a battle roll dump out of the front headlock position. And I want you to see how those two tie together. Most high level techniques have a bit of a push pull. I will have a threat in one direction if they don't react, obviously we get it. But most of the good moves, whether threat in one direction, which cause a strong reaction in the other, leading us to a follow-up attack that works better. We need to cause reactions to our opponents, to give us strong reactions back. And if we just sit in front head, stay on an elbows, never attempt to build high. Never attempt to move with just basically waiting for our opponents to hit a front head attack or a go behind from these positions. So we're going to start with the soccer drag, which should be basically the fundamental front headlock escape where you should know in this context. We're going to talk about the soccer drag now. Of course, the soccer drag could occur out of resting the changes, which is obviously where the move comes from. But it has to be something we know if we want to play a turtle game. Again, you can't get really good at defending a traditional turtle position, but be afraid of the front headlock. Because things like this will happen. If you've spent a turtle's aggressively here, you might sort of at such a good angle that they end up head to head here, right? If we go back instead, if you does a half a turtle in that state behind the arms here, that's when you end up in a traditional turtle's stuff we were talking about earlier, right? But if you hit the real aggressive one, and he ends up here, now he's forced to fight out of a front headlock. And a lot of traditional digital stylists will say, you should look to pull guard out of here, right? And look to see bottom position, right? But of course, we don't want to conceal anything, especially if our goal is to path back to the feet. So again, in the first section where we talked about basic get-ups from referee style position, you saw we had a clear path to get up. And along the way, when they were out of position, or overly aggressive, because we were in most considered a bad position, they took big movements. And not only lost the position, but ended up on bottom. You could see how we could shake them off of those positions. Front headlock is obviously a better position for map. But a ton of weight and spent the heat control position, but of course there are opportunities for us here. In a situation like this, the basic first step we want to do is a soccer drag here, right? So when you drill this, people have a lot of trouble drilling in front head, because it is a dynamic position. Us should just try to learn wrestling, and we try to learn wrestling in a static way. But wrestling is very, really showing in a static way. Very rarely when we be here, there'd be a bit of a push pull to be potential angle changes. But he dispenses first rep should be coming forward. If you can never grab a leg from this position, that's going to be a great idea. Now we can start turning this into potential, single legs, wrestling and changes, whatever. Obviously not front head, he's going to be sprawling those legs back. And if we wanted to sprule those legs back and put more weight on us, we can push into it. When we push we feel some reaction back, when they're spruling on us here, their weight is top heavy. And if we were able to hit, which we're going to show soon the soccer drag, we could potentially have them full forward and take their back here, right? But of course, if Matt's knees were close to us here, and his weight son is knees here, and his hips are back, if we were to hit the soccer drag here, he stays in position. Soc a drag, we need them to have weight on us here. For them to have weight on us in this position, they have to feel some form of threat. They have to respect you even when you're in this bad position. And now, you can see, Spencer made a slight movement forward. Matt is putting more weight on Spencer in this position. Spencer's going to build up to his left leg, knee pointed to the sky. He's going to first use his left hand to find the near elbow here. Matt's elbow in a perfect front head should be completely hit and then retracted. If Spencer gets to the elbow, he's now well on his way to flipping this position. And he's well on his way really, again, to flipping it. But if you get to the elbow, it's a good chance about my leg going back out because he's now quite out of position, right? Spencer gets to the elbow with his left hand. He does a hand assist. You can see he goes from left hand to right hand. He gets a tight grip on that. A lot of people think a sucker drags just a drag because obviously it's cool to sucker drag. But we need downwards pressure here. So we're pulling down and across. When we pull down, Matt's weight comes down and forward. If we were just pulling across, he might be out of flight it with backwards pressure because it's more like an arm drag. So Spencer's pulling down as he starts to circle, he's head out. He immediately reaches for the fire hip. He pulls the elbow forward. He pulls this elbow to me. So Matt leans even further forward in this position. So Spencer pulls this arm to me and it starts to bring Matt's weight towards the upper body, able to hip a perfect sucker drag. Let's stop again from the same side. So again, we're in this position. Obviously, if Matt's screw is super hard and he's position is good and he's elbow is hidden here. Obviously, it's going to be tough for us to do anything from this position. Practicing with the training partner, don't do this, but also don't have your knees completely forward here and be sitting on your pocket. This is a super stable position. Obviously, we can reach for the legs here and potentially do other things. So you've got to try to be realistic in a dynamic sense for the situation. That situation is Matt's putting weight on Spencer because his weight on Spencer, he's vulnerable. Spencer can start building some heart with his left leg. He can reach for that elbow. We reach for that elbow first with the same side hand because it allows us to take a firm grip. So then we pass it off to our second hand. This is a stronger grip. Spencer could do it just reaching with one hand. But ultimately that one hand grip wouldn't be as strong as if we had a hand assist. Spencer starts cutting the corner and reaching immediately for the fire hip as he pulls both down and across body. And now Spencer's turned where he was in a bottom-side control, he's turtle to aggressively ended up in a front head, Matt's tried to put weight on him, and he's turned this into a circuit track. Now let's do it from the opposite side. So again, everything from the start there you saw from that side. So Spencer's going to do the first few steps. Same side elbow grip. Bill time does a pass off. Now look what he does with his head here. Come back. When he pulls down hard, it allows him to really free his head inside here. If we come back instead, if Matt was pulling up time, it actually kills a bit of Spencer's mobility. That's why we have to pull down on the elbow and it allows Spencer. You see his whole body starts to turn and you're going to see his left arm is both pulling mats elbow down to the floor and across. And it allows Matt to fall forward. And when this is done live and when Matt's putting full weight in, he might even completely collapse to his belly hip. The harder Matt sproves, the more he's going to collapse himself here. So Spencer does it a bit more live. Exactly. That's more how it's going to look like right. But again, when you drill it in somewhat of a dynamic manner, where obviously there's not zero weight on you. And obviously as you learn, there's not 100% weight on you. And if you can drill it under that environment, that's when you be able to apply in a rolling situation. Let's talk about the importance of shoulder position when we're attacking a front head attack. And also when to say that concept, you're going to see how it applies to a lot of really front head in a wrestling standpoint versus front head submission attacks, right? So if Matt has Spencer and a front head, right? If Matt showed it, it's firmly above Spencer's head here. And he obviously has a touch and strap here. And if this elbow is retracted, it's hard to find here. This is quite a strong wedge. It's hard for Spencer to bring his head inside. Really, it's hard for Spencer to place his left ear in the center of Matt's chest here. It's quite a bit of control, right? If Spencer grabs this elbow, and we should basically what we're doing with the suffocity. He pulls that down, super hard. He's pulling it down, and now he's able to get his left ear inside. Because the shoulder, this armpit isn't controlling the back of the head, right? So when a wrestling front head style, Matt wants a very shallow chin strap. And he wants to hide his elbow as far away as possible. But if we start thinking about Jiu Jitsu submission, if he goes for a high wrist, he's putting his elbow deep. And whether it's a high wrist or a high elbow building thing, this is in the same position. We reset back to regular front head. If Matt goes for an anaconda chuck, he's placing this elbow inside. Obviously, when we're talking about clearing these positions, I don't want you to practice this and let the guy get dead to her right here. If he's fully secured with anaconda on the other side, he's simply doing this. It's quite a stable position already. Matt's got to lock on the far side, which is going to make him a ability difficult anyway, right? Where these positions of vulnerable is if we start again, is as he transfers from wrestling style front head to Jiu Jitsu style. That's where the vulnerability is, and now we can substitute out your inside. The vulnerability is within the transition. It's not within the lock. Within the lock, we have to do other things we have to think about how we can address breaking that lock. Something really interesting from wrestling is basically, and it's another concept we've done, as well. Remember what's going to be about pulling the elbow down here, it's not simply as easy as I'm just showing here where Spencer can pull this arm all the way down here. It's going to be tough here, right? Again, for a man, two foot seven, thirty pounds. It's going to be very difficult. If you have to overpower Matt, especially Matt at five, three, one hundred and four, five pounds. So we need to find a way to get this shoulder to the floor. If we've ended up in a front head and Spencer's right arm is controlling an inside leg position. So like an inside knee pull here. Say he's gone for inside knee pull, he's been spoiled out in this position. He's got this inside leg position, right? We don't want to allow Matt's leg to come up. We didn't have this grip, and Matt lifted this knee to the sky and he was on this flip. We couldn't pull him easily this way, because this is in the way. We come back the stuff. If we're holding that lower ankle, half calf area and we're pulling that towards us here, it's going to be hard for Matt to raise his knee because he'd have to flare his ankle to get it up. Now with at least controlled one post in that direction. Now we're going to use a lot of hand to control this elbow here. And we're going to pull that down as hard as we can, right? And now Spencer can start to collapse to his left hip with the ultimate go of getting Matt's shoulder to the floor in. When he's showed us to the floor, there's nothing behind Spencer's head and he can dip his head up and come on top it. Again, this is going to work for a high wrist, high elbow, any form of attack that actually deepens Matt's arm here. So we'll go again in the same, so we'll also show the other side here. But this is going to be, it's going to take a bit of practice, right? Because if we do this in correct, let's take all the correct grips. But let's say we don't touch Matt's shoulder to the floor. If he can keep his shoulder above our head, now when we try to clear it, we're stuck in that as good chance we're still going to be submitted. But let's say we pull from this position and we touch the shoulder to the floor, we clear our head. We clear our head because we're clearing this shoulder position. Let's do the exact same thing from the other side. So we're in this front headlock position, right? So you guys saw what happened on the other side. So Spencer's going to take those grips. Spencer's going to be, he's going to hold that elbow and he's going to have full with his own body weight too. He's going to lift his right leg off and see here. Let's do this, but let's face, keep going. If Matt showed us not on the ground, Spencer tries to clear his head. It's jammed. It's jammed within the body. If he pulls Matt's shoulder to the ground, now Matt's trying to hang on. Go on. We can slip that ear inside. It's basically another form of that elbow pass. Elbow pass, of course, being what we demonstrated, the very first concept we did from this position. Let's do this one again. There's one concept here. Touch their shoulder to the floor. If you can touch their shoulder to the floor, we're going to clear this position here. And the beauty of holding onto that elbow and touching their shoulder to the floor, just like in the first move we did. In the first section with the turtle escapes, the single hook will be pulling the elbow. When this shoulder is on the floor and our body is above them, we're able to guarantee we end up in top position. So just to see this in a more realistic setting, let's have Spencer facing this way, bottom so I can drop. And you on the other side, Spencer keeps that far turtle and Matt secures the front head. Immediately, Spencer grabs him so I'd like it. He grabs the elbow. He's going to dump Matt hard. He needs to get Matt shoulders to the floor. And that's exactly how it's going to look like, right? And what's great about this technique is Matt, no matter how hard he holds on, he's out of position. So he's done an energy and we're easily able to slip at it, very frustrating for the god it was just in a good position. All this he very satisfying for us, we were in what was considered about position and we're able to flip it out at the last second. Basically a barrel roll dump, but it's going to work in the jujitsu setting too, because what makes a high elbow, high wrist, even at a corner style attack, gives us the ability to do that helps us do this technique. Let's look at it from where we're actually originally saw this move, Resta Austin de Santa. He has the de Santa barrel roll, right? It's in a particular way, finishes single legs. But I think it's very applicable to jujitsu because sometimes out of cycle control, we can turn in and shoot ahead inside single. Or as we turn out, total like in the previous moves, maybe they leave that leg too close and this time we get ahead inside single outside grip versus that inside grip. So you're gonna see this now, spaces inside control. So there's a lot of different angles here and a lot of parts of the moves are going to be on opposite sides of the camera run. If in this situation, if matters in the cross-face, we're not turning in, right? So we'd have to turn away. But let's imagine in this situation where Spencer maybe is defending the cross-face he benches across face away and he comes straight off to a single leg here. This is the most common way, I think we could get ahead inside single, right? Obviously sometimes we're playing half guard under her calf, we come up, these things could happen. But we've turned bottom side into a head inside single, we come back again. Let's say the cross-face was too powerful, obviously you guys don't really see the cross-face. He can't turn in, maybe he turns away, that has match, Jason's instincts, I want to secure the head inside single. All you need to know about this side is we've got a head inside single and we've built a bit of heart without left leg that. We use that leg as a driving leg, that's very important here. Now I want both of you guys to rotate so we can see this side of the camera. What Matt's done is basically more of a jiu-jitsu guy star response here, right? Matt's grabbed around the neck here, he's hoping that if Spencer didn't defend probably Matt could essentially sit into a arm and get a thing to whatever he did. And he's attacked. Very common, did you just want to buy them? We wrestle up, we get caught in a front head style attack here. What we're going to do is we're going to grab this elbow. We're going to grab it as hard as we can. There's no arm assist, there's no possible here. We've got a one-on single leg on the far side, and we have a super strong grip here. Because again, what we understand based on the previous concept is this shoulder is our problem here. The shoulder with this shoulder is the most stuck out head is. And if we can touch this shoulder to the ground, we're going to free out head. But it's obviously not as simple as just pulling here. I want you to show the single leg to the camera. Keep going on this side. So he's holding the elbow on the other side. He's got a driving leg. He's going to pull Matt's shoulder to the ground as he lifts the single leg. You can see it might be hard to see it, but Matt's shoulder is on the ground here. Keep going. If he's shoulders on the ground, we can simply pull that head on top. And now we're secure top position. The front head attack, the chin strap, Matt elected to take, has now cost him top position hit. But if we go back slightly, we head to the start. If Matt's shoulder is not off the ground. If he's deep up, he's sitting right up. Then to try to pump his head up, tough. But if we have pulled this shoulder here, the head easily pumps out. Let's do that from a couple of different angles. So let's start in side control bottom. Again, he's a situation where we may have got a two-on-one on this wrist. Grab this wrist too. If we kill the cross-face, Matt has no ability to prevent us turning in. We turn into a single leg here. Matt immediately grabs the front head. Again, you guys saw we showed you what Matt was hoping to do. Immediately jump on the neck. Matt's hands are pre-occupied by controlling this submission here. If Matt's left hand was on the ground, he's got a good frame here. But he's attacking the neck. Both of these arms are pre-occupied by the neck. We've got control of one of his legs. He's merely hanging onto us. We pull his shoulder to floor and lift the leg. And now we can easily pull our head on top there. When we can choose to go to side, I would probably recommend a step-up of both legs here. And now we go to Mount or a potential leg-right situation here. But what I want you to practice with your training partner, again, is to do it correctly and incorrectly. Really get a feel for this. Even if Matt's a good straight to the single leg will let you jump down. Even if Matt elects a higher wrist attack here. One of the worst things to possibly clear. If we hit this dump correct, we can still pull our head out here. Because his shoulders trap to the ground, it's not behind our head. And we can easily pull our head out. So something I think we haven't seen a lot in judicial yet. But something I think based on front head style attacks. And the assumption that a lot of people choose to defend wrestling with submissions. And I think even though it is a wrestling move, it still applies very well in a judicial setting. Both of the soccer dragon, these battle roll dumps feeding very well together, right? Because when we're in the front head, this Spencer has a grip on Matt's leg here, right? And Matt's got the front head. When Matt's leg is so close, he's obviously not sprawling on us. There's not a lot of weight on us here. Which would make the soccer dragon hard because he could resist it. It might allow us to clear it, but it's not going to allow us to really hit a powerful subject. Because we want his weight coming in, right? If Matt is aware of the battle roll dump and we grab the elbow here, we're setting up Matt's scrolls hard. And he loses weight. Now we immediately do it hard to the outside, and we can go straight into the soccer dragon. So it's kind of like a one two. Whereas a thread of one helps us with the secondary move. So I want you to play around with both now and understand how one can lead to the other here. If we go back into that exactly again, see, Spencer's slow, no, he's got leg control here. He grabs that elbow. And that heel doesn't see, he goes, he's leg out of there. That allows us to quickly pass off and hit the soccer dragon. So let's see, no, a ton of explanation needed for this. But it's going to be up to you to be able to practice putting these two together. And obviously, it's an easy cue. If we have the leg, we hit the barrel roll. If the legs out of reach is a good reason to believe that's sprawling hard on us. They have weights, top heavy, bang, we can hit the soccer dragon. So I'll find little drill to practice. But of course, if we just have one move from front hand, if all we have is the soccer dragon. But there needs a close. It's going to be difficult for us to pull this off. So we want to threat the leads to a heavy scroll. And that's going to allow us to hit the soccer dragon better. And obviously, of course, if they don't scroll, move number one is going to be very effective, which is the bow world don't. Here what you're on in a bonus, it's a move. I stole from society, right? It's a really cool move from total, right? So I've spent this in total. Matt has got double on this. He's driving a ton of weight for it, right? He's driving really hard to spend. He's even too heavy to even get a little bit up to the hook up. Obviously, you can't climb up with his hands because there's so much weight just up a body. And he can't find the space to even hit that knee slide technique or doing right? If you guys face the opposite direction here, you don't keep going. Matt has to have this inside leg up, right? If he was knee was on the ground, now he's weights on the ground. Spence can stand up. If we come back, he has to have this leg driving. If he uses the other leg to drive, it really is a kind of a... He has to switch his hips to the other side of the body. If he stayed in the same spot, he couldn't lift that leg easily. It would be a useless leg to lift up. Yeah, he is. Spence can still stand up. The drive leg, we know what it's doing and we know where it is. Because it has to be directly behind our spine here to keep pushing us forward, right? And this now let's face the camera good. Because we know this is here. We know Matt's hands are preoccupied because they have locked around us here. Spence can take his right hand and grab the same side rest. He wants to hold that rest here, right? He's securing it. Now let's face behind us if it's for me. So he can just go to risk control, right? What he's going to do is he's going to use the closest leg to this post leg. He spends a don't do this yet. At the same time, he's going to keep risk control. He's going to collapse to the same side shoulder. That's going to allow him to hit a little bit of a donkey kick under this knee here. And you're going to see because Matt's hands are occupied. The hand you would have to post on to prevent this from happening. We're hanging onto it. So when Spence hits this, we can knock Matt to his butt here. What's key about this position is Spence that keeps his right wrist controlling Matt's right wrist here. And he's gluing Matt to his body here. This is how we maintain top position. If he let go of that wrist, Matt will retract that arm and come back on top. So now we're using his grip against us. The grip that he put here, that we simply hold in position, allow us to get to this spot here. Spence wants to stay heavy with his upper body and mat here. He can pumble his other arm inside. And he can get Matt's elbows high above his head. And Spence on walks his hips back. This is very important if we come back. Spence it just walks too low to the hips. Matt can still suck this stuff. We have a scramble here. The way we kill a scramble is climb his elbows above his head here. So just a real fun technique. Let's see if we're going to come up with different angles here. This is great if someone's sort of stalling. So stop from the very beginning of your elbows on the ground. Matt's driving as hard as possible here. We can't even get up. These pressures heavy. We grab that wrist. And again, we know where the other leg is because it has to be behind us. You had to generate this much force into us. We hit that semi donkey kick. He can't post. Again, he can't post. The wrist he would have post on where grabbing here. We hold onto that wrist. If we didn't hold onto it, Matt would retract that arm. Get back on top. The arm that he put in position is allowing us to now pin him here. You see, he spends almost inside. He sits back towards the head here. And we're able to secure the top position here. So just a little fun sort of thing we can do. And again, it's why it's a situation where we need to come on to pull the rabbit out of the hat here, right? They secured a body load. They're completely heavy on our upper body. We know a food of four point that wouldn't do us. A lot of good because they're behind the arms here. And they're also directly in line with our spine. It's kind of a stalling position. We have to, again, pull the rabbit out of the hat. And if the hands are preoccupied by the holding the body, we read and force it. We kick. The hand we're holding is what they have to post. So they're forced to do some more of a shoulder roll in that position. And at least forces is gravel. Even if we lose the wrist, it's better to have a scramble out of that position than it is to just be merely stuck into it. We need to make something happen as we don't move. Another fun little bonus here is probably my preferred attack from front head now. And it's from resting as a shield's joke. The shield's brothers would use this. I believe to choke guys out in wrestling when they fall to sleep because they wouldn't want to. They wouldn't want to roll through with this and let the guy score. They would choke them unconscious and pin them. I believe it was, uh, became an illegal move, right. But I use this in Gitu because obviously they don't roll through. They get submitted as you're going to see if they roll through. It's a great way to go to other front head attacks. The appropriate time to do it really. I believe there's a four point position to quad-pod. So we're in this quad-pod position, right? If Matt returns to his elbows. Most of the time when people come up and go to their hands now. You'll see that biceps are quite close to either side of their head. Obviously if Matt's hands will weigh wide here. His base is going to be, uh, he's going to be able to be able to choke him with other things here. And I think we pretty, he's basically a bit more compromised here, right? So usually you guys will stand up with biceps close to their head. What we're going to do, we're going to have a chin sharp. And we're going to control the tricep hip. We'll try to pull the tricep a little closer to him, right? And I won't necessarily have to pull it directly across. I'll pull it a little bit to me. And now it's close to him. Now the chin strap hand is going to slide through and go palm down. It's going to be shallow. So don't reach too deep. Don't go too deep. A shallow is possible. The elbow grip is going to slide up. We're going to take a palm to palm. We're going to pinch our elbows tight together here. Just like this here. What we're going to do is we're going to start to bring our head underneath their armpit. And we're going to circle a little bit here. Keep circling, keep circling. Matter of this thing. And we get that submission. Let's do the same thing from the other sides. We can see that last part where Matt's getting choke really hard. So you see what holds, what allows the choke to work, set it up again. Same shallow grip, shallow grip. We're going to elbow it by pressure. It's key the head goes under the armpit. You'll see if Matt is really resilient here. He's still going to get choke there. So you'll see we're going to go. We get that submission. And we'll do the exact same thing again. But this time. And this is what happens in a judicial setting. Obviously in wrestling they wouldn't want to conceive this. But in a judicial setting, Matt starts to feel some choking pressure. He rolls with it to relieve it. And now we can go straight into the other front head attacks. Or we could just simply use it to get top position here. So again, it's a great, great strategy. I'll show it, Matt as well. So Matt's in total. You go all the way down a total. As he starts to come up, I try to pull and close this distance here. If Matt faces the camera, I don't want any space here. I want to pull this arm here. So he comes up. I keep it tight. I take a shallow grip as possible here. We go forearm to forearm. Now start to bring my head inside. And we get the submission roasted. And you can see it's still tight. But my head is out of position. So I have to start passing off easy to other submissions. Or I keep this tricet up. I pinch them up and start securing top position here. So again, a little fun move, a little bonus. Just shoots tricet. Very, very low risk. It is a lot of risk because I'm reaching, but I'm not reaching crazy. I'm trying to reach the bad minimum here. Obviously, my elbow is going to be slightly compromised. But not as compromised as some of these other sort of front head style attacks.",

        "text": "What's up everyone? We just finished shooting my closed guard DVD. Close guard was my first ever game when I was starting my Jijitsu journey and lately I'm coming back to that game a lot and I'm trying to take some dust from that from that move. And I want to share with you that the moves I know, the moves I use and the moves I'm working on right now to put into my game. So this DVD is going to be all about sweeps, back takes and submissions from the closed guard positions and also some situations when you open and trying to pass your guard. When he's trying to open up your guard or he's standing up to give you some troubles and some hard times in that. In that close guard position. So check it out and see you soon. Let's start with a little position overview. So. Close guard, we usually gonna start with our legs locked in quite low, right above my opponent's hips. And now whenever we're fighting close guard, I want to I want to first check how it's his posture and what's his goal. Whenever he's posture up high, that means that he he'll try to pass my guard probably he gonna try to like open up my legs. He's gonna like manipulate that trying to open them up and then after opening up my legs, he will try to pass my guard. Now whenever his posture is low and his chest is close to my chest, then I know that his goal is to stall in a position. And then here comes another part, what I have to do here. Whenever my opponent is staying low, I need to create some distance. So I'm gonna try to push him back, I'm gonna try to scoop my hips out to create some space for myself and create an angle for the attack. Whenever my opponent is high here with his posture high, first thing I'm gonna take care of is his posture. So I always look for posture break. And I have a lot of tools to do that. I can like put to his colors, I can get to his head, I can get to his shoulders, getting all sorts of grips like on the hook and over the shoulder or a wizard grip here. So my goal first is to break his posture, whenever I break his posture, two things happening. First thing, he's getting tired here, fighting for his stance. Second thing, whenever I break the posture, he's not able to get to my legs and that's very important for me to keep the guard. So second thing, whenever I break my opponent posture, I'm starting to look for an angle to attack. So whenever our bodies are aligned, it's kind of a neutral angle, I'm not really able to attack much from this position. My legs are not very mobile and I can't really create any offense here. So first thing I do before I attack, I need to create an angle. I have to either scoop my hips out. So right now I'm able to see my opponent's back and I'm extending his arm, or I'm gonna change the position of my upper body, moving towards 90 degree angle here. So this creates possibility to attack as well, because right now I can easily manipulate with my legs, I can extend his arm, I can work with my legs to sweep my opponent. Same thing applies, whenever our opponent is standing. So the most dangerous position for me, whenever my opponent goes off, is when my opponent is fully posture. Whenever he's postureing up, I know that right now he's able to open up my legs and whenever he opens he's gonna step back and try to pass my guard. So whenever I see my opponent trying to stand up, I want to keep his posture low. So I'm still gonna break his posture whenever, whenever his posture is low, go out on your feet. So he's on his feet, but his posture is low. Whenever his posture is low, even though he's on his feet, he's still vulnerable here. So I can still attack his legs, I'm not his arms, I can still get into his legs here, and I can still work with my sweeps. So the thing here is I can allow him to get on his feet, but I can never allow him to posture up fully. Now very good way to control my opponent, to not let him get up, is getting to so-called high guard. So I'm gonna climb with my legs towards his shoulders. So whenever I break his posture and whenever I'm able to create an angle, I'm gonna climb with my legs towards his shoulder line. Right now, my leg is covering one of his shoulders, and one of his shoulders free. Now it's gonna be really easy for me to move with my legs to manipulate my legs and to get over his head or to use my legs to create a motion to sweep my opponent. Same thing on that flag, whenever he's going up on his feet. So whenever I'm able to keep his posture low from this position, I'm gonna climb to the high guard. So my goal is to cover his shoulder with my leg. Whenever I cover his shoulder with my leg, this is not gonna stay on top. In this case, in this case it's gonna be easy to use that flag for the attacks. So top flag, the one that is over his shoulder always stays on top whenever I lock my feet here. So right now we're gonna go through some situations when our opponent is setting his controls on our body to open up the closed guard and advance to eventually pass our guard. So we're in the closed guard situation and my legs are low. So that's usually the first position we're gonna get into the closed guard on the level of his hips. And very basic type of guard opening is whenever my opponent is trying to get the grip on both of my hips and then he's trying to drive his elbows inside all towards my thigh to then open up the situation and start advance. And this is very easy type of control to deal with. So whenever this happens, what I want to do is I want to get the grip on my opponent's call, I can pick whatever call I want and now I'm gonna use my thigh bringing them up towards my chest. So what's gonna happen here, my opponent is only controlling my hips, so he's controlling quite low. Whenever I'm using my thigh to bring him forward, he has nothing here to set a good base from. So eventually he's gonna post his hand behind my head. So from here it's gonna be really hard for him to stay in the position fighting with both of my legs. My legs are stronger than his arms, right? So right now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use my thigh to bring him forward. And I'm gonna help myself with the control on the collar as well. So I'm bringing him forward. And what's important here, whenever we break our opponent's control, we don't want to let him go to start opening up our guard again because then we deal with the same situations over and over again. Okay, so whenever I whenever I'm able to bring him forward and break his posture, I want to tie him up here on him to stay. So first thing, I'm gonna go over his shoulder and I'm gonna grab a nice grip here underneath his armpit. So right now it's gonna be already hard for him to push your back up. Now this hand from the collar, I'm gonna dig it underneath his arm and I'm having a nice control over his pattern arm. So from here, I can start advancing with the position, opening up the angles to attack. So most of the time, from here, if I don't want to stall, if I want to actively attack, I'm gonna open up my guard and I'm gonna put my foot on the map. From this foot, I'm gonna get the push, go with my hips outside. Now whenever I'm able to scoop my hips outside, I'm gonna lock my legs again on his far hip here. Every year, I'm ready to advance with different attacks that we're gonna see later. So once again, so whenever he's grabbing both of my hips, I know already that he can't get any pressure on my upper body. Right, he can't set a good control here, so he's not gonna be able to resist and fight against my power of my legs. So I'm gonna get the grip on his collar and I'm gonna drive my knees up. Once he touches the map, I'm going over his shoulder and I'm grabbing the nice and tight grip here underneath his armpit. Now I'm going underneath and I have a head and arm control. From here, foot on the map, and I scoop my hips out. Now I lock my legs on his far hip and I stay tight from this situation, and I'm able to start attacking. So right now my opponent gonna control my both biceps to keep my upper body on the map and to actually immobilize my upper body. And then he gonna try to advance in his passing from that position. Okay, so let's see how to deal with that control. So again, I'm having a low close guard on the level of his hips and he's putting exactly control over my both biceps. So most of the time from this situation, my opponent either wants to stall or he wants to get a push from my biceps to stand up and then try to stand up. And then he gonna try to put his knee between my legs to open up the guard. Okay, so whenever this happens, I want to act quite fast because I don't want him to stand up and I don't want him to get that knee inside. Right, because that's gonna create a lot of problems for my guard. So whenever this happens, what I'm going to do is I'm not going to stay with my back flat on the map. Instead of that, I'm going to scoop my hips out. To do that, I need to put my foot on the map here. So I'm going to scoop my hips out and right away after I scoop, I want to close my legs again tight on his forehead. Alright, now whenever I get here, I'm going to, I'm going to bulk his elbow with my hip, right? You can see now that his elbow is lying on my hip. And from here to get rid of this control, I'm going to have to go underneath his arm. So I'm digging with my arm and then meet his arm and then I go around his arm. So from here, most of the time, I'm able to start attacking his arm here. But if I feel like, if I feel like this arm is still a problem, I'm going to do the same thing on the other side. So I'm going to put my foot on the map, scoop my hips out all the way. And I'm going to dig my arm underneath to grab my opponent's arm from the top. As you can see, when I'm scooping my hips out, I always love my legs on the forehead to keep the position tight. So I always, I always want my heel to touch his hip bone here, right? In this case, the position stays very tight. So as you can see, we already deal with both of his arms and we're ready to attack. Because his posture is low, his posture is broken and I got a good angle and arm isolated to attack. So once again, he's controlling both of my biceps. So whenever I stay with my back flat on the map, it's going to be impossible to drive my to dig with my hands on them because his elbows are most of the time tight. Even if they're not, whenever I try to get on the knee, he's going to tighten up the position and it's going to be impossible to get a proper leverage here. So first, I need to scoop my hips out, lock my legs on the forehead. Then I drive my arm underneath to get a control from the top. If I feel this is a problem, I'm going to do the same, I'm going to repeat the whole thing on the other side. So right now, I'm going to put my foot on the map and now I have to make a big move with my hips all the way to the other side. So I'm moving my hips to the other side. I lock the legs on his hip bone. I'm going underneath to grab it from the top. Now from here, I'm able to start attacking my opponent. So right now, we're going to go back to the control that we already talked about that will bicep control and now we're going to counter our opponent control with a sneaky shotgun number. So the situation for the Omba is going to be whenever my opponent is getting to the control. Whenever he settles the control and he stays there for a while, it's going to be harder and harder. So whenever he gets to the control, I like to act fast to surprise him. So so we're aiming for the moment when the situation is not like saddle yet. He's not like 100% in the in the position. Okay, so he puts his hands on my bags up here. First, I'm going to scoop my hips out like I did before to bump his elbow with my hip. All right, so again, I have to open up my closed arm and I'm going to scoop out. Now from here, I'm going to go with my hand here underneath his jaw to push his head away. So this motion will extend his arm and right now it's going to be easier to attack this arm. All right, because whenever he feels I'm attacking the arm without a control of his head, he's able to use his body to close the situation and to not let me attack the arm. So we want to extend the arm as much as we can to make our attack more efficient. All right, so first, I open up the closed guard, bumping my arms with my hip and I'm going to get the grip on his tricep here. So as you can see, I'm having like a no big grip, C grip with a thumb on one side and four fingers on the other side of my hand. I'm going to grab the tricep right above his elbow and from here, I'm going to stop pushing his head away. As you can see, the more I isolate the head from the shoulder, the more extended the arm gets from here, I'm going to raise my leg and I'm going to put some pressure here on top of his tricep. Now from here, we already we already have a perfect situation. The only thing I have to do is I have to use my grip here to push the arm down and towards his head in the same time. So I'm going diagonal, I'm not going straight down, I'm pushing down and towards my elbow, right? So one more thing, as you can see, my elbow is here, locked and tight. I'm not trying to raise my elbow to cause that pressure. Actually, whenever I raise my elbow, the pressure is weaker. Whenever I lock my elbow, I can generate more pressure here and it's easy to get beyond lock. So the same concept applies, whenever my opponent grabs double collar control. You can see the same kind of control from my opponent, but instead of biceps, I'm going to get the grip on our collar and he's going to drive his fist towards our armpits. So in this case, I'm doing the same thing. I'm going to go with my hips outside to bump the elbow and I'm going to use my hand to grab it. One thing you have to know about is whenever we aim to get this shot down, we have to be quite fast, because whenever my opponent will feel that we're going to his elbow and we're applying any type of pressure, he's going to work towards the other side to neutralize it. So whenever I'm feeling that there's a situation for me to shoot, I need to be fast. So I'm going with my hips to the side and I'm pushing his head away. One important thing about this head push is I want to use my stiff hand control to push his head away. Whenever I use the stiff hand control, it's going to be very hard for him to break that control, to break through that control. All right, so I'm going to extend the arm as much as I can. Now here's the same thing. I'm going to lock my elbow and I'm going to apply diagonal pressure down and towards his head to get the arm up. So he gets, he gets the control here. I open up my God. Slide to the side. Now this hand goes underneath the jaw. So I really don't like to push the head. Whenever I push the head, it's kind of a slippery control and he can like slip away from that rotate the head and we have end up with no control. Instead of that, I like to put this line of my hand underneath his jaw. So whenever he tries to look at me now, it's going to be kind of painful because my hand is going underneath his jaw here, causing some pain. You feel that? All right, so we're going to grab a secret here right above his elbow. We're going to scoop the hips out and we're going to put the pressure here on top. So very important thing, whenever you feel that your opponent is trying to rotate his elbow down to escape the pressure towards your hips like here, you have to actively work to rotate his elbow up. All right, so I never let him rotate it down. I'm actively rotating his elbow. So his elbow is looking towards the ceiling and now we have a proper angle to finish the attack. The same concept applies whenever my opponent grabs double-speed control or bicep control and then he's going up on his feet. So from here, I'm going to get the grip on the tries to begin and now I'm going to put my foot on his hip here and I'm getting pressure on the outside. I can add a stiff on control here just in case, so he got the same shoulder on the shoulder here. So the third one, most of the time it's going to be so quick that you don't even have to push his head away. But if you feel like you're going kind of slow, you can always add additional control. So from here, I've already had it. If not, if I still need to make adjustments, okay, I'm going to put my hand here just to have a better control. I'm going to adjust rotate his elbow up a little bit. Now I add the pressure. As you can see, whenever he's going up on his feet, the most important thing to create pressure on his elbow is going to be this leg. Right now, I'm having a nice bass on his hip and I'm using my leg to press against his tries to begin. So right now, we're going to talk about a very legit type of control in a closed guard. One of my favorite controls when it comes to playing on top when you're in a closed guard. It's a control when you open, it's controlling double collar and you're hip. All right, so that's in my opinion the most dangerous control here from the top because it's in my opinion the easiest way to open up the guard and advance with the passing. So whenever this happens, I'm not able to move forward with my upper body, right? So I'm not able to sit up now to maybe drag him towards him. So he has a very good and solid posture right now and it's going to be very easy for him to keep me down. So my main concern here is this hand. Without this hand, he's not going to be able to open up my guard. So first, I'm going to cross grip here and I'm going to get the grip on the bottom of the sleeve and my second hand digs on the knee and I'm going to grab my wrist here. So as you can see, we're having a figure four here. Now I'm going to use this structure here to break the grip. But the only way I can really break this grip easily is up to the ceiling. Whenever you want to break it to the side or towards your opponent, it's not possible. So I'm going to pull it up here and as I said before, whenever you break the grip, you don't want to let it go just for your opponent to recover the grip or other other type of grip to open up your guard. So you want to advance in a position. So from here, two ways I like to advance in a position. I like to counter my opponent. First one, I'm going to drive his arm to the side and I'm going to open up his back for me. So whenever this happens, I'm going to grab his back here on the knee on the his arm pit and I'm going to open up my guard now and I'm going to scoop my hips up. So as you can see, I'm already halfway to his back. So I can start attacking from here or I can start climbing his back to get the proper leverage here and to get the proper opening. I'm going to use a stiff arm control here. So I'm having a figure for here, break it up towards the ceiling and now when I'm going with his hands, his hand towards the side, I'm going to put my knuckles here towards his form. So in this case, it's going to be very hard for him to come back with his elbow. What's more, I'm controlling him with a stiff arm control. So it's even harder for him to come back. His elbow is totally open. And right now, it's going to be easy for me to set up an angle for attack. So I can easily climb down towards his back or attack. So that's the first way to open up my opponent and open up that back to the situation. Now second way, I'm going to get the same structure here. So I dig on the knee like grab my own wrist. I'm going to pull it up. But instead of passing the arm to the side, I'm going to shoot with my bottom hand here and I'm going to wrap his arm around. So from here, to make this control tighter, I'm going to pass my collar here. So as you can see, we're still kind of aligned here. So it's not going to be easy for me to attack now. So the same thing as we did before, I'm going to put my foot on the mat and I'm going to scoop my hips out. Right now, again, I'm working towards the proper angle to attack. Whenever I scoop my hips out, I want to climb my legs on his chest and on his back here. So it's going to be very hard for him to push her up now and his arm is exposed here for attack. So once again, so figure four, I break the grip and I'm going to slide in. But as I'm sliding in, I'm going to extend his arm with this one, the top one. So I'm extending the arm and I'm putting my own arm behind my head. So now it's going to be very easy to wrap to wrap my arm around his arm very high. I'm aiming to wrap it around his arm around his armpit, right? I'm going to pass the collar to make the structure stronger and now I'm going to put my foot on the ground. And I'm going to slide my hips towards the side. If you feel it's going to be hard just with the foot on the mat, you can always place your hand here on his shoulder and get additional push here. So right now I scoop my hips out. I'm going to lock my legs on the far hip and I'm going to clamp my legs around his upper body to not let him push her up and to keep his arm extended and open for attacks. So we're going to do those those two techniques from another angle so it's going to be more visible for you. So we got a figure four, break it towards the ceiling and I'm going to pass the arm to the side. Still far in control, get the grip on the knee of the armpit, foot on the mat, slide my hips towards the side. I lock my legs again, now I can advance. So that's the first option. The second option, figure four, I break the grip and now I'm going to extend his arm and I'm going to shoot my arm through to wrap his arm around. I'm going to pass my collar towards my hand to make the structure stronger, foot on the mat. If I need to, I can use my hand here on his shoulder to get additional push. I lock my legs and I clamp my knees on his upper body. So as you can see, the arm here is pretty extended, pretty much open for attacks. So right now we're going to deal with an opponent who doesn't want to move much and he's going to try to use his elbows to immobilize our hips, so we're not going to be able to move and get the proper angle for attacks. What you're going to see here is the concept that you're already clamping the legs on his upper body to open up his arms, foot on. So whenever my opponent stays low and his elbows are here controlling my hip, first thing I want to see which side my opponent is looking to. So whenever he's looking to one side I know that it's going to be easier to push his head towards that side. So from here I'm going to use both of my hands to push him away and I'm going to extend my arms. So whenever I extend my arms towards this side I know that this arm here on the other side is going to get a bit weaker. So from here I'm going to open up my god and put my foot on the mat and post and I'm going to scoop my hips out right here. Now whenever I scoop my hips I already have the angle so I'm going to use my leg now to put his arm a bit a bit higher and I'm going to lock my legs on his far hip. Now I'm clamping my legs together on his upper body and now I'm going to work with my hands to control his arm. So right now again we're in a good position to start attacking his posture is broken and his arm is open. My angle is good. His arm is kind of extended. He's open for attack. I can advance from here. So once again so his posture is already low but that's his goal. He want to mobilize my hips. So from here I'm going to push his head away. To make it easier for myself I do the little move with my upper body. Alright so in this case it's going to be easier for me to extend my arms. If I would like to extend from here can be hard. Especially if he's going to stay tight here. But if I make a little move towards the side with my chest now I'm opening up an angle for me to extend my arms fully in a comfortable way. So I create some distance here. I'm going to put my foot on the mat, scoop my hips out and now my leg is going up on the knee for his armpit driving his arm up towards me. Whenever I do that I'm going to lock my legs together and I'm going to clamp my knees on his upper body. So from here I'm just going to use my arms to stop setting up the attack. So what I want to get here is his arm on my hip. That's the perfect situation to start attacking his arm. So right now we're going to go through another very important concept in a closed guard. Getting from low closed guard that I was mentioning before the one that we lock our legs on our opponent's hip now we're going to climb higher to lock his shoulders. Whenever my opponent has a control over me, first thing I want to do with is this arm. So whenever we stay aligned it's going to be easy for him to keep me down. But he's losing his pressure whenever I go with my upper body towards the side. So I'm going to do that but first I want to get some some grips here to keep him closer. So I'm going to get my grips here and I'm going to go with my upper body to the side. Now as you can see it's going to be easier to bring him down just a little bit from here when he's when he's posting on my chest it's going to be impossible to bring him down. But if I'm going to change the angle here he has no power to push away from me. So it's going to be easier to to bring him down a little bit. And now from this situation I'm going to start climbing my legs up. So as you can see this one comes up from the hip towards my opponent's armpit. And another the second one comes above his shoulder and I'm going to lock my legs down here. So as you can see I'm having a close guard but it's very high. It's on the line of his shoulders right now. So from here it's going to be very easy to set up any kind of attacks because his both arms are right now are exposed for the attacks. But this control is so efficient that sometimes you don't even have to pass the leg to get the armor by only by extending my hips now and staying tight on his far shoulder I can get the arm bar here. The very important thing when you get to the high guard you want to have this leg here above his shoulder and I want to lock it from the top. In this case it's going to be very easy for me to use my hips to open up the position but also this leg is always ready to go around his head. So once again. So he has a control. I'm going to get some grips here but I'm not going to use them yet to get any kind of like serious control. So my main goal here is to step from the line of his pressure and from here I'm able to climb up. So first I'm going to put this foot higher on his rib cage underneath his armpit and the other one comes above his shoulder to lock it. As you can see only one shoulder right now is free. The other one is covered by my leg. So that's a nice position to start any kind of attacks. I'm going to start attacking with the triangles by pushing his arm in and keeping his head inside. As you could see I was able to get an easy arm bar. I can also push his head away. So I have a lot of options here. Sometimes you're going to feel wherever you switch the angle you can feel that you have no power in this leg to get really high here. So in this case, especially when he's working actively with this arm to push my leg down. First thing I'm going to do, I'm going to post my foot on his hip here. So I have more power now to bring this leg up. So as you can see when I'm bringing this leg up, it's my leg is setting up a perfect angle for attacks. The more I go towards 90 degrees angle, the easier it is for me to get the proper leverage to sweep him or get any kind of arm loves. So from here, I'm going to lock the position, I'm really fed up. So once again, first I'm going to get the grip, sleeve and collar, and I'm going to move my upper body towards the side. So as you can see, I'm stepping out of the line of the pressure. From here, I can go right away with my leg high or if he's opposing here, I'm going to put my foot on the hip. Now I'm getting some extra power here to bring this one up. So whenever I bring this one up, I'm setting a nice angle for attacks and I'm taking power from this arm. From here, I'm going to lock my legs and I'm going to stay tight, ready to attack here. Right now we're going to talk about one of my favorite controls to actually achieve both. Break our opponent's posture and set a good angle for the attack. So whenever my opponent has a control over my upper body and my hip, I'm going to aim first to step out of the line of his pressure right now. Right now, if he's like in front of me, it's very easy for him to push me down. So it's going to be extremely hard to get a cross grip on his collar. I'm going to aim for the cross grip right now. Even if I want to get that the classic one mirror grip, it's still kind of kind of hard whenever he has this one on my solid plexus. So first thing, I'm going to get the cross grip here on my opponent's sleeve and I'm going to turn my upper body a little bit. So right now he has, he has just a little pressure. It's not the same here. Here is a strong angle for him. But if I turn, it's not so strong anymore. So I can reach for the collar now. And right now, what I want to get, I want to get a really deep grip on the collar here. So I'm going all the way towards my opponent's neck and I'm going to bring him forward. As you can see, when I'm bringing him forward, I'm using also my legs to do that. So I'm using this motion, bringing my thigh towards my chest. And my goal here would be to pull his elbow in. So I want his elbow to cross the central line of my body. Whenever this happens, whenever I'm able to pull his elbow in, I'm able to start climbing to the high guard. And now we're in a very good position to start attacking or sweeping our opponent. One thing that we need to mention about is this arm going towards my opponent's collar. So whenever this arm goes above my opponent's arm here, this arm is getting weaker. So I never let my opponent, whenever I get the cross grip here, I never let my opponent to go above my arm because now he's bending my arm in. And this arm is not so strong anymore. So to use this rule on my favor, I'm always aiming to get above my opponent's arm. So as you can see now, it's going to be easy to bend his arm in and to pull him forward. All right, so let's go once again. So from here, I'm going to get the cross grip on the sleeve. First, change the angle, step out of the line of the pressure, and I'm going to dig deep for his collar. I'm going all the way to the neck, and I'm going to pull my opponent down. From here, I'm going to start pulling the elbow in to cross the central line of my body. And now I can place my foot on the hip, and I can start climbing up to set up a high guard. From here, it's going to be super easy to start attacking my opponent's arms. Or, uh, transit to my pladas, or sweep. All right, one thing about this position, as you can see, I'm always actively pulling his arm in. Most of the time, he would like to pull his elbow back. So I'm not going to be able to attack with the elbow. So you have to be ready to fight here. So it's always a fight to bring his elbow in. So it's always a fight to pull his arm in, because he would like to escape with that arm, right?",
