        "text": "What's up guys, we're here again with BJJ and little stunning here. Sorry, my hair, my beard are all messed up again this time. I get a chance to cut it before I came. So, sorry, you're going to have to deal with this. As of right now, I've been working on the system for like the last year and a half. And let's talk about what the system is and what, what, why develop it first of all, okay? It's going to be a combination of other Toriado system, like so, with a camping subsystem where I camp and I hang out on my part as J point, which will talk about it a little while. And a combination of a high step series from both reverse and an outside deliva, like so, to get past my corner's hip and past my corner shoulder line. Okay, so that's just a basic general idea. Let's look at why I developed the system in the first place. Back, like 2015, 2014, 2015, all I really did was leg locks and scrambled to the back. But my game was built around attacking the legs and it was very little guard passing in there. It got to a point where everyone in Henzos was so good at leg locks that they came almost impossible to smidden me with leg locks. So now it's okay, well this is no good. I'm scoring fewer and fewer submissions per round. How can I up my, my submission percentage? So I started passing people's guards. So if I can pass the guards, I can pin them and I can take their back and then I can finish them. So I started using body lock passing, okay, and that was successful. I worked for six, eight months and it was great. I would lock my hands out and ask people to body locks. Then everyone started to get kind of hip to that and they realized, okay, the corner knots is handy. So whatever I started doing, the story keeping hands inside, knees inside, and big body locks incredibly hard to get to. Or they just flat out started playing a simpon game where now there's no lower back exposure and I couldn't actually go in and lock body locks in my partner. I said, okay, what the hell I do now? So I started playing game where I forced people into half-guard where however, maybe they ended up in half-guard. And then I'll get some kind of control of the upper body where I passed the leg and I go and I control the head. So I switched my hands and I go and I control the head and I would use that and start passing their guards. And then they got to a point where they started doing a really good job of keeping inside position and half-guard. I couldn't come forward anymore and I couldn't get to upper body inside position. So then I was like, well, what the hell do I do now? I can't pass the body lock and I can't pass a linear into half-guard. So then when I started doing, I started using a torreado game. I would tour around though, the outside of my partner's legs and I started out plugging them and passing. And then it became increasingly harder and harder to get outside of my partner's legs and pass the hip line. So then I started developing a camping game where I'd tour on the one way and then I started going across my partner's legs and having the risk of re-engagement. I would start camping on my partner's hip line like so. So I could spend more and more time pass the hip and pass the shoulder line. And then it came to a point where my trainer partner got so good, where I would go for the initial torreado. My partners started opening up their legs and making it impossible for me to even outflank them. So then this leads me into my high-step series where if I can't outflank my partner who likes to reach in towards me, you go in, so we start playing a high-step game. Parkinson's are going in and passing my partner's legs. This is initially why developed this passing system that you haven't really seen this too much in competition. You saw a little bit in my Roberto match, in my full on my fill, bro match, but you haven't really seen it because number one, I've just been working on it recently and developing it. And my stomach was less too bad so I stopped competing for a while, so you haven't really seen it. Another reason why you really haven't seen it is because the more basic your opponents are, the more basic your moves have to be. And most of my opponents are terrible, so I've never got to this level of sophistication when I, when I'm working that passing guys in competition. Because I go out and they just allow me to bodylock them right away or force them into half guard right away and immediately pass their guards. Um, I've never, I've never gotten to a point where I couldn't tour down the way guy couldn't lock my hands in a half guard or bodylock and had to start high-step thing, I would just go out and easily pass their guards. So the level of sophistication with guard plays not at a level where it would merit me to use such an advanced passing series. Um, in addition, I'm in a heavyweight bracket, most of the time we're almost a play bottom position. So I want to spend most of the time in a match and places that would lead to submission. Instead of going out and fighting a guy for three, five, six, seven minutes on take downs and then having three minutes to work. I rather just go out, sit to guard and spend the ten, full ten minutes trying to submit the guys that are wrestling first and then trying to go down to the floor later with the less amount of time to work. So I just go out and I sit to guard and I do either leg locks or backtakes and I do most of my work from bottom position. You don't only see me passing too much. You can see why you haven't seen me use this. It's because of the fact that if you look at my matches, everyone knows I'm a very good guard passer. So what they try to do is everyone just wants to knock it submitted, right? Everyone tries to do is instead of playing guard, usually there's an unspoken role where one guy is the passer and one is the guard player. They'll break this unspoken role and they'll just try to stand up and see this very clearly in both of my Wagner matches. You can see it in the Tim Sprykes match where guys just try to freak out and stand up and get away from me. So you're now your primary goal is to avoid submissions and pass your partner's guard. It's to hold your partner down and you can actually attempt to do a guard pass. So when your partner tries to get up and get away from you and stand up in a way, it's an arc in keeping your partner down and you change your guard passing based around this. So the focus now is it's changed from passing the guy's guard to holding the guy down. You have to change your passing style a little bit and we'll talk about this in the future in a different different series. More of a scrim and dressing series but we'll talk about it eventually in the future. So you haven't really seen this kind of passing because my partners are so terrible or my partners are so terrible that I can just easily lock my hands and pass the guards and they're trying to get up in a way for me. I usually overextending trying to push away and that allows me to get some form of connection with the upper body, whether it be with a body lock or with a top head and arm, things like that double under hooks. Because they're overextending so much trying to stand up that I can actually lock my hands and work more basic passes that you know most of us have seen. So we're going to experiment now with more advanced passing systems and I have someone who's very, very good at keeping upper body inside position and now not allowing me to get. Either connection at the waist or connection on the upper body, making it very hard for me to start flanking my partner. You know, you always deal with those guys there. You feel like you go to engage the guard and they're like dumb be and they're so flexible and you feel like just nothing you can do to get past our guard. Those are the guys we're looking to pass now guys, but incredibly good guard retention. It's very hard with guys who are very hard to make a connection at the upper body or at the hips with body locks. Alright, so let's look at this new philosophy I have when we're talking about guard passing. Now this is going to eat a loose passing series. It's not going to be body lock or half guard passing, it's just going to be based around a loose series of flanking and high step. If you look at the number one thing that your partner needs to effectively play a guard against you, what is it? It's a connection of their legs to your body, okay? If your partner can't form a connection to your body with their legs, they have no guard. Any guard requires some form of connection to your body with their legs. If they can't do that, they can't play a guard. So I got into a habit mentally of whatever my partner forms a meaningful connection to my body with her legs. It throws up red flags in my head and I'm thinking what is the fastest way I can disengage my partner's legs and flag them. So every time I forth my partner forms some kind of connection whether she grabs an ankle, like so, and she wraps up with Alfred Delihiva, any time I partner forms any meaningful connection, I'm like, okay, this siren's going off my head. How can I disconnect and fly? I partner doesn't do an ashigurami. No good, this connection to my life. How can I disconnect and flag? So I just play this game just by thinking to yourself, never let your partner form a connection to your body with their legs. If you have the means to do this through skills and knowledge, it's going to be incredibly hard and incredibly exhausting for your partner to do anything. There's nothing more tiring than your partner constantly pulling needs to chest. Trying to engage your legs to you, the legs are just flopping around and your constantly side to side and their legs can't form a connection to you. There's nothing worse. I probably trying to engage me, the whole time the legs just can't form a connection. This is exhausting for your partner. So I don't spend time in front of my partner where legs are engaging me. I spend time in flagging positions where it's incredibly hard for my partner to get anywhere close to me. And this is the philosophy we're talking about. It's disallowing your partner to form a convenient connection with their legs to your body. We're looking to spend more time. Pass our opponent's hip and pass our opponent's shoulder line. Then time spent engaging my partner's legs. The ideal, this is obviously very hard to accomplish. The ideal in a match. It's to spend more time camping. We'll talk about camping as I can. Camping passion partners, hip line and camping passion partners shoulder line. Then your partner, then time spent engage inside your partner's guard. Okay, so if I can spend more time in this position in a match, then I can spend in this position or in this position or in this position or in this position. In a match, you're going to win this match. You're going to pass your partner's guard. So that's the ideal. That's where striving towards. So if we can't achieve that, we have a vision of what we're trying to do. Okay, now let's talk about J point or J spot camping. First of all, what is the J point? There's a critical demarcation line on your partner's body. Where if you walk past that point, your partner is in jeopardy of having that guard past. Okay. This line is the one that draws the hips together. The hip line. Anytime, I can get past the hip line from this point forwards. My partner's in real jeopardy of having her guard past and she has to give me a real reaction otherwise it's going to be passed. Right now, this elicits no reaction. If I step, she might partner's hip line. This elicits almost no reaction. If I step past my partner's hip line, this elicits a huge reaction. We're now, I'm perpendicular to my partner. She can no longer engage me in the legs and so she puts herself back in front of me. And now from here, she can go and start to engage actively into a guard. So, what I'm looking to do is to constantly find ways to flank my partner and move past my partner's J point, which is the hip line, like so. And even better, past my partner's shoulder line, like so. If I can do that, it is going to be very hard and very exhausting for your partner to maintain guard. Now, so we're going to look at an idea called camping, where I physically just can't. I park myself on my partner's J point. We're going to look at more and more of this in a few minutes. Where I physically can't, in positions like so. So, my partner who has been tangling me with the legs, she's using a ton of energy. I'm using none. Okay. So, I can, how my partner's J point for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 seconds at a time. Until my partner just so exhausted, she just needs to drift away from the chest. You pass your partner's guard. Now, it's so exhausted. It's pretty easy to work through a submission. Okay. So, between the ideas of flanking your partner and not allowing them to connect the legs and meaningful ways to your body. And constantly working to camp on your partner's J point or beyond the hip or beyond the shoulder line are super super, super important. There's a couple of athletes who actually do this very well. The kings of this are the men's brothers. They work really, really well. Walking past the hip one, the footwork is beautiful. They do it a lot in the knee. Moving past the hip one, moving past the shoulder one. They put a drastic amount of pressure on side to side. I'm on, on their partner. But they do it with a movement base game. There's two ways you can camp at your partner's hip line. You can do it with a movement base game where you walk from side to side. Or you work around your partner's head and you walk it to north south and side to side control. Or you can do it with a negation of movement game where I physically camp and I don't move. Once I get past my partner's hip line, I don't move. Okay, so playing with these two ideas of constantly walking past your partner's hip line and shoulder line and camping past that point. Staying past that point is going to be an idea if you play with that and you can constantly walk past the hip one. It's going to be incredibly hard for your partner to maintain guard. And at that any point, your partner engages the legs in a meaningful way. So it's going to pressure on you or off balance here. These throughout red flags and your head and you say, \"Man, this is not good. What's the fastest and most effective way?\" I can disengage my legs and immediately outflank my partner to move beyond the straight point past the hip or past the shoulder line. If you work with these two ideas, it's a very simple idea. And everyone knows this. Okay, she knows that you're trying to outflank her and if you do, it's going to be difficult for her to maintain guard. So this is the game you're playing. She knows that she doesn't want to get outflank and you know that you want to outflank her. But if you can just keep these two simple ideas in your head throughout this entire series, everything's going to become much, much easier. They're very simple, not easy to accomplish, but they're simple ideas to work with and now we need the skills and knowledge to be able to implement these ideas. So let's talk about a cranial shift. I mentioned this before. What is a cranial shift? We talked about cranial shifts actually in the first passing instructional, systematically attacking the guard. But we didn't have a name for it back then. Let's talk about one of the goals being pinning your partner's upper body controlling the head and the shoulders. Either before you pass the legs or after you pass the legs. And this is what a cranial shift is at some point. You have to go from passing your partner's legs to controlling the head and shoulders. Okay, and you treat and pass your partner's guard technically without controlling the head and shoulders. But you can't really pass our guard in a meaningful way where you can isolate limbs and attack them unless you make a cranial shifts. And so what that means is by the body's up, for example. And you see this in the homelo match 2017. I pass, you can pass your opponent's guard with control of your partner's weight. So your pass your partner's legs technically yes, your pass your partner's guard, your partner's guard, your perpendicular. She doesn't have the legs engaged anymore, you score your points and you pass your partner's guard. But doesn't mean anything until you make a cranial shift where I go from passing the legs to shifting to the head. So I make this cranial shift where I come up and I go from the passing the legs to controlling the head and shoulders. And if I can't do this, like in my homelo match and I come out and I try to switch and he brings hands and side and now you can regard, I can't attack it. I can't attack her upper body and isolate limbs in any meaningful way unless I control the head and the shoulders. So we're going to talk about making this cranial shift while we're passing where we go from passing her partner's legs. You can control the head and shoulders. It's easy to pass your partner's legs. How many times do you see matches in live training or competition, guys passing the legs? Happens all the time. Who I stand up, I tore it on though, I passed the legs. I'm passed my partner's legs right now. But passing the legs, getting past the legs, and actually passing the guard are two different days. If I can't control the head and the shoulders, I can't pass my partner's guard. I have to make a cranial shift. So passing the legs and actually performing a cranial shift in passing your partner's guard are two very different things. And we have to understand that when we're passing. So that's what a cranial shift is. Now, let's look at distinguishing between certain types of passes. We can pass into a side control, we can pass into mount, and we can pass into north south. Now, this becomes very interesting. When I pass into side control, when I pass into mount, I have to perform a cranial shift. Why is this? When I, in order to pass, there's no way I can effectively pass my partner's guard into side control or to mount. And then, use it to attack them. Okay, so with distinguishing between just passing their guard to score points and passing their guard to actually attack her attack and submit your guard. There's a two different things. If I want to attack and submit my partner, I have to make a cranial shift when I pass the side control or to mount. And there's no other way around this. Okay, if I want to attack the upper body. But when you pass to north south of your passenger partner's shoulder line, this is the exception. This is why passing to north south is much easier if you look at competition. It's much easier for a high level guys to pass to north south against an incredibly good guard player who is good at keeping upper body inside position. Because when you pass to north south, you don't need to make a cranial shift. Passing to north south is the only pass when you don't have to actually control your partner's head and your shoulders to actually get pass your partner's guard and attack them in a meaningful way. When I pass into north south, I don't have to control the head. If he has a knees up, all I have to do is beat those knees, beat the elbows, coming with my hips. And now I've successfully passed my partner's guard. And now I'm passed the legs, I'm passed the guard without controlling the head in any way. I have to enjoy my partner's arms. And now I can start doing it and attack my partner's arms without having any direct control over my partner's head. So cranial shift has super, super important when you're looking to pass into side control or into mouth, which is a large part of what we're going to be doing today. But if you're looking to pass, if your pass your partner's shoulder line, then you're passing into north south. And you don't need to have a cranial shift, the north south pass is the one exception to the cranial shift. So if you're passing when you're passing the hip line on the J point down here, and you're passing into mouth and side control, you need to have a cranial shift to where you go from passing the legs to controlling the head in shoulders. If you're passing to north south, you don't need a cranial shift, and you can pass successfully pass your partner's legs past the guard. And isolate limbs without direct control in the head. [Music] Alright, I'm going to present the very hard to small pill for some of you out there. And you're not going to like what I'm going to, I'm about to say, but it's a fact and there's no way around this. If you guys want to become a true guard passing master, if you want to reach your true potential as a guard passer, you have to become a master, or at least incredibly competent at leg locking, and why is this? If you play a game where you're trying to pass someone's guard, and you know that if they enter into any kind of Aussie or army, they're going to leg lock you. They're going to sit down to the butt or sit down to your butt, and then go into attacking your legs, and you're going to freak out to get out of the way. Or if they get into some kind of Aussie or army, you're so afraid that you rip out of the Aussie or army, and you run away and you reset. You're never going to reach your full guard passing potential. You're always going to play a timid game where your feet and legs are back in a way from your partner. When you play a relatively low passing game, and every time someone cuts your legs, you swallow legs back in a way, you run out in a way you disengage, and then you go back into your partner's guard. This takes away a very large portion of your passing material. You have to carry on those that are hard to do. Someone inverses into your legs, and you freak out. The highest thing is out of the equation. There's a lot of passing that you won't be able to do if you're afraid of getting your legs into it. And even if you do this passing, and someone enters into an Aussie or army, for example, and even if you can rip out in a way, let's say, okay, I don't. I'm afraid, if my partner says me down for me, she's going to leg lock me, I'm afraid of leg locks. I feel like she's much better than I am. Even if at any point, you can be like, okay, I can just bail, and I can kick my leg out and run away. That's counterproductive to the passing guard. You're moving away from your partner. It's much better to be able to stay in the pocket. And passage, and that you can go into actual passage from here. And knowing that worst case scenario, your partner sits you down, tries to go into attacks in your legs, and you just repomble and you break your partner's leg. So you have to be able to have the confidence that if you try to do these passes, and not just these passes, other passes as well, and your partner enters into your legs, and tries to play leg lock, a leg lock and game with you. You can either, for the bare minimum, stay in the pocket, disengage your legs, and put real passing pressure on your partner, or worst case scenario, your partner sits you down to the butt, tries to leg lock you, and you just repomble, get back on top, or repomble, and then go into attacks in your own partner's legs, and counter leg lock your partner. You're never ever going to reach your full guard passing potential unless you're highly competent or an expert at leg locking, and there's just no other way around this. To pass with a passing, a standing manner when you're going as a strong, strong leg locker. If I try to do these high stuff passing, I'm sorry, playing a game from here, and then, for example, I lose my partner's partner's far-light, and she goes to start inverting, or out my leg leg, so if you, if you're, you know, freak out for me, like, oh, no, my legs ain't get broken. This is not what we want. You should be able to stay calm and know that you're going to be able to pass your partner's guard from here, even when she goes to even when things go south, and she gets into your leg. Well, worst case scenario, you can repomble the legs and get out. You can counter leg lock your partner, and so on and so forth. So understand that, if you're looking to master, especially this high stepping system, where I use a Toriando game, and I use a game where I'm high stepping out of my partner's guard, and my legs are presented to my partner. If you want to master this style of passing specifically, and all guard passing, you have to become a highly competent, if not an expert in the area of leg locker. And I'm sorry to tell you that to some of you because I know you're not going to like it, but it's true, and there's no other way around this, and the fast you accept this, the faster you can progress in terms of guard passing. Alright, so let's look at a quick little overview of what we're going to be looking at in this in this passive series, and the how the breakdown's going to go. The first thing we're going to look at, everything is going to be passing an opponent from a simpon guard. Alright, we're going to be working on, I'm going to be standing, and my opponent's going to be simpon. If my opponent is seated, we use all of the stuff we're using in the previous system athletes attacking the guard, the first version. I'm always principal storming the same. This, this is just an addition to that, so I'm not saying just to use these and then don't use anything that I showed to those all the same concepts still apply. I think I haven't watched it, I'm assuming you have. You haven't watched, I recommend watching that one first, so you get the general idea of passing, and this is a more advanced and more advanced series. But all the same, all the same ideas apply, still fainting with the lead legs still going in body locking and hand by and all that, but this one is built around, Torgon those and highest that passing, so we're going to be doing everything against a simpon opponent like so. The first thing we're going to look at is fainting, and we're going to go into depth in all these sub-experts, we're just going to run through the overview right now. The first thing we're going to look at is fainting with Torgon does, where I use various things, yes, my partner. Off-bounds and I get tensed through my partner's legs, okay. Won't be at the same thing, and then we're going to go into basic Torgon does, which we've already talked about. But we're going to start to review them and then go into how I can use Torgon does to move into situations or get start camping on my partner's J point. So when you use fainks to start to get tension on my partner's legs, they're going to use Torgon does to outflank my partner, and then we're going to use camping scenarios where I outflank my partner. And I move to this J point camping that we're talking about, and we'll expand upon it in a little while, okay. Then once we start once we get through the camping series, then we're going to go into the high step series, both from. First, Elohim position like so, and an outside Elohim position like so, and then we'll work on passing both side control and to north south from all these series, and then once we finish. Once we get through all of them, then we'll look at the unification of all of these series and how they tie together into one coherent system, okay. So we'll go fainting first, get tension on my partner's legs, the Torgon does to outflank my partner, camping to stay flanked, then we'll go into high stepping, and then we'll look at the unification of all of these passing both. So I control Mount north south and then we'll move around from there. So let's look at something really interesting when you look at guard passing. If you take the two best guard passers of all time, the two best hinners of all time, gui and no gui, it's me and hydrograisey. And if you don't want to, if you say that Gordon sucks and I don't like him, I'm watching at BBDs, but I hate him. That's fine. If you don't have to think, you can leave me out of the equation. If you just look at hydrogra. All of hydrogra is passing, he was good at all different kinds of passing, but the primary focus of all hydrogra's passing was to force a half guard chest to chest. If he got you pinned in a chest to chest half guard and made an upper body connection with a cranial shift, he was going to pass you, he was going to mount you and he was going to finish you or take your back and finish you, okay. The overwhelming majority of my passing is to just force my partner into half guard, right? When I body lock someone, it's unlikely against a high level player. They're going to just pass right away into a side control. But if you force half guard and you make a cranial shift, you can flatten someone out from half guard and get past that top arm and get past that top leg, it's going to be incredibly easy to pass someone. If you have a direction of moving first to half guard and then passing them from half guard. Not just any half guard, specifically a chest to chest half guard where you have some kind of upper body connection, your pastor partner's cross shoulder post and your pastor partner's top leg. So a lot of this instructional, just as the entire body lock instruction was built around passing someone or forcing half guard to pass. So this entire instructional is going to be focused around either passing someone and if I can't pass them, forcing half guard. We've talked about backtracking before we talked about it a lot and the body locking instructional. And I haven't filmed half guard instructional right now, I'm doing a matter of order, but I'm probably going to talk about it in that one too. But I'm a big advocate of moving back into my partner's legs. I provided it on my own terms right backtrack into my partner's legs in order to go to in order to get a more advantageous position that I originally wanted. And a perfect example of this using this system is in my Roberto Jimenez match where I was touring on the one side, I tore it on the back the other side. I started camping on the J point and then he was moving moving scrambling and I presented my leg to allow him to catch half guard and I flattened them out and passed them from half guard. So forcing half guard and going back into your partner's legs and backtracking into your partner's legs provided on your own terms is one of the most effective ways we can get a strong pins and then passes after that. So we're going to use this entire series if we can't get past right to side control right to mount or right to north south. Fourcing half guard chest to chest is almost just as good, so it's going to be a big focus of what we're going to be looking at today. All right, so let's look at engaging a simpon guard in the correct fashion. Now what I'm going to show you is not going to be like a look revolutionary or a revolutionary or anything, but it's going to make a huge difference when you're actually trying to pass the toy on those. When I go to engage my partner in a simpon guard, I'm going to come in behind my hands, but I don't want to do is just walk in toward my partner and then she just entangles my legs and make forms of connection right away and now I'm getting off balance. So I want to come behind my hands with a staggered stance, but I don't want to hide my hands with a square stance and now if she backs my hands forward clear them anyway she has to act with both my legs. I can move behind the staggered stance so even if she backs my hands forward, she only has access to one of my legs and not to. Now in addition, when I come behind my hands, I'm going to put my hands right about mid right below midship. I'm going to do this with my hands to easily, I don't control her legs at all, and if I go towards the ankles, she can pop up the legs out and it's hard to control my partner's legs for any amount of time. So I go about midship, dry below midship, so she goes to pop up the legs, it's harsh made a hole to hold them and I can hold them for a little bit longer than I was just. And if I was down all the way on the ankles, okay? Now, when I go to engage my partner, even if my, even if my feet are staggered, notice here my center lines are still aligned, okay? What I want to do is I want to miss a line my center line and my partner center line, so you have two choices here. If I want to step in between my partner's legs and split my partner's legs or a crashed center and start to go into various times of passing, where I start using where I start using. Just lose passing here, where I'm pumbling on top and things like that, and we look at it and passing in the first passing instructional, that's fine. But if you want to flank your partner, and I'm always going to look to do, as I'm going to look to put two feet on the same side of my partner's body. So instead of stepping into this position, and now trying to start my turn on the work from here, where my foot aligns with her center line. Like so, I have to start tore down this from here. The second I step in, I kick a small step to the outside, so that my lead foot is on the outside of her hip on the side that I'm trying to pass to. So when I go to step in, this is very subtle, but it makes a huge difference when you're passing. When I go to engage my partner, instead of stepping into this position, and doing my work from here, I step in like so. So now, my two feet are outside my partner's hip, and instead of having my foot in the center line, my foot is outside my partner's hip one, like so. What this does is it makes it incredibly hard for your partner to put legs on you, to attach to her legs to you. If I go in here, my partner, I can only hold my partner's legs for so long. I don't have the luxury of having grip to my partner's knee pants like I would if there was a jacket. For now, when she gets to reach towards me, I can start pushing the legs, and I can hold her legs for a long amount of time. I can only like control my partner's legs for so long, so she clears my grips which she eventually will, and I get this before I make a step, she's engaging my legs. Whereas here, when I outflank my partner, and I move to a side, even if she clears my hands, it's still really hard for her, she has to change an angle first before she can really engage my leg again, okay? So this gives you the extra time that you need to start a tutorial on those secrets. So when I engage in some fine guard, I come behind my hands, I go relatively mid-shin, as I walk in, assuming I'm looking to flank my partner, I walk in like so. I catch, I take a step out, and I shuffle, one, two, one, two. I get to an angle, okay? This is so much more effective than starting everything from here, just a small angle change. I'm going to make a huge difference for us, and we'll see why in a second, okay? So we can behind the hands, and we move to a flight with a lead leg outside our partner's hips, two feet on the same side of the body, rather than one foot aligned at the center line. All right, I know we went over this, and the past, but it's super boring because everything we're doing today is based around Toriando, so assuming you didn't watch the first instructional or you need or vision on it, we'll go over Toriando footwork, okay? When you're looking to hit Toriando without the geek, understand that you don't have the luxury of robust grips on your partner's legs through the pants, so you can kind of cheat with your footwork when you're working in a geek, because you have control of your partner's legs for long amounts of time. When you have grips in your partner's legs, without the geek, they're just grips that are used for touching go methods. While I just touch, I throw, and then the hands usually come off as my partner highlights, and I have to re-grepp and throw it to the other side. So what actually gets you pass your partner's guard is the precision of footwork when you move side to side. So your footwork is actually doing to work, not your hands. The hands are just a supplement to throw the legs and the opposite direction to get your partner's feet and knees pointing away from you, which is one of our goals from the original passing instructional. So as your partner's feet come towards you, you throw them further than they wanted to go, and then you step across the other side. So the precision of footwork is what gets you pass your partner's hip one. When I'm looking to pass my partner, okay, we're just going to do this with no hands, first of all, just so I can have the footwork and then we're going to add the hands and later. But I'm looking to step with the toy on those. I'm looking to step, pass my partner's hip line every time. I have to step past that jeopardy point where my partner's in jeopardy having a guard pass. Otherwise there's no pressure. If I toy on them and I go here, there's no pressure, I toy on them and I go, it is no pressure. But if I just take a small step and I go past my partner's hip one, now when she goes, now when she goes to react, it's a big reaction and she has the high leg over, she has a face meat, she can move her whole body in order to not get her guard pass. So our basic tour down the footwork is going to be from a situation originally initially outflank our partner. Now we're going to take a small step outside with our left foot. And depending on where you start your tour down the front, this will be a bigger or smaller step. If I start with my foot, splitting my partner's center line, this definitely will be a little bit bigger. If I start with my feet out of this position, it'll just be a very small step to the outside. Okay, and then I'm going to take a cross step past my partner's hip one. Again, depending on where you start, this will be a bigger or smaller step. If I start here, it'll be a big step past. But if I run to an angle, I take a small step and then the cross step is basically just straight to my partner's hip. So instead of stepping across like so, I just step straight up here. And now from here, I make a pivoting motion so that my knee points toward my partner's forehead. And I step to my partner's J point to hip lines. And from here, my knee points toward my partner's forehead chest, your partner, a big partner will always bring a leg up, throw a leg over and enter into your legs, and now you're getting beaten this position. Now you're going to pass 50/50, your partner has cross-harmic and thanks to the fall part. So I always step like so, and now I pivot. So that my knee instead of pointing towards my partner's forehead shoulder, point towards my partner's forehead. Because of my leg position now, this will just inherently make it harder for my partner to enter into my legs again. And I'll make it harder for her to enter into my legs. I'm possible, but harder. The main reason why I do this is so that I have readily accessible V-drips to my partner's legs. So when she goes to leg lock, may you bring her legs up into an Aussie growing, I can actually access my partner's legs. Whereas here, I know access to my partner's legs until they're actually in tangling. So just when I go to the step to the side, we come in, I start from this position. If I start right in front of my partner, we take a big outside step. If I start flanking my partner, we take a small outside step, and then we just step right to our partner's hip. Like so. Now we take a pivot where we take this foot comes around, it was above my partner's shoulder line. And now we'll well pass our corners J point, we have access to the legs, and now my partner will have to bring an easy and order to knock in our guard pass. Okay, stepping to one side. So we can step to one side, very easily. Like so, if we're going to the other side. So the same thing, or if I start an originally with a flank, small step, straight step, and then we pivot. Now you saw it to get used to this and you start going side to side. So I go in, I originally initially step and we're here. Now as my partner's knees are coming in to regard, I'm going to take a very small step back out past my partner's hip one. Here, I don't go here, so far away, or now I can't reach the other side. I don't go so close, or my legs hit together, I stumble on my own legs. I take a small step right out past my partner's hip one, like so, so that my foot points across my partner's hips and the same direction or hips are pointing. And now from here, I just lean my weight on to one foot, and as your knees come this way, I take across that across my partner's body. And I pivot. She goes to bring her knees in, take a small step, and I pivot. Knees in. Every time, you can get well beyond your partner's hip one, with this stepping pattern. Right, going to come in, initially, we're here, she brings the knees in, as she's bringing the knees in, I'm going. So once we get the footwork pattern down, now we bring the hands into the equation. Hands come in, and I don't always ask me, \"What group are you trying to make in your partner's legs?\" And here at the moment, it doesn't matter what group you make. Your hands are for touching go method. There's a variety of groups that you can make, and you're not going to let set your grips as you want them every single time. It'll be here, sometimes it'll be here, sometimes it'll be here, sometimes it'll be here. It'll be here, but maybe a group you can use. The only thing you're looking for is some kind of connection to your partner's legs, so you can touch and go. So the second you go to bring your legs in, I just grab the legs, I touch, as she goes to bring the leg towards me, I throw them, and then I go. She goes to bring the legs in, I throw them, and I go. I throw them, and I go. I throw them, and I go. When every time I'm past it, it's a jade ball, and she has to give me a real reaction, otherwise using jeopardy, of getting a guard past it. This stepping pattern, and by the throwing of the legs, you can stay consistently, pass your partners, pass your partners hit one, on either side, going back and forth, and putting incredible amounts of passing pressure, side to side, as your partner goes to re-guard. And the whole time, there's no meaningful connection of her legs to yours. So now we're going to look at an idea of creating tension in my partner's legs. Now what is the advantage of this? A little thought experiment. If I ask you, or if you ask me to pick up a sunny, to carry your 20 feet from this side of the room, which one would be easier. One where she's standing up, and her entire body is flexed, or one where she's on the floor, dead weight, and I have to pick her up and carry her across the room. Obviously, it's much easier to move her when there's tension going through the body, because you can easily move the whole body around you know exactly. If I put this much energy, the body's going to move this far, as opposed to just picking up a dead body and everything's all flopping around. This is, this is true with guard passing. People all have those guys who are super flexible at their legs, and you try to move them, and they're just flopping around. They're like gumbi, and you try to move their legs around, and they're so relaxed that it's hard to get any real reaction to that of them. And it's hard to move around, it's hard to spin their body, it's hard to move them around. Same thing with arm bars, if I'm looking to go into arm bars, as a defensive player, I want my armers relaxed as possible, so my partner has a hard time moving it around. If someone's trying to extend my arm in an arm bar, and I'm flexed the whole time, and I'm trying as hard as I can, to not move my arm, it's easy for my partner to know who the arm is moving around. If you pull it, you pull it, you pull it, you know exactly where it's going to go, but if it's relaxed, I can move it back and forth relatively easily as much harder for someone to control it. That's the same thing with the legs when your guard passes. If I can create tension in my partner's legs, it's going to be much easier to move my partner around, and to either outflank them or stuff the legs or move the legs where I want to. So just playing with this idea will make things much easier. If I go to move my partner's legs and they're relaxed, it's hard for me to pull around my partner. But if I go to move my partner's legs and she's tense, now I can move my partner exactly where I want to. I know exactly how far my partner's legs are going to move, whereas when they're relaxed, it's a hard thing, I move my partner and I don't get any real reaction with the rest of her body, her legs move independently of the rest of her body. But when it's tension, now when I move the legs, the whole body moves. So our goal, as passers, is to create tension within my partner's legs. So that when I move the legs, I get a real reaction to the rest of the body. The question is, how can we create that tension? And the answer is, think it. All right, let's look at some things, just basic things in front of my partner to get the great tension through the legs. Now you can faint in front of your partner when you're still engaged inside some form of guard. When you haven't passed the J point yet, you can faint beyond the J point when you're passed the hip line and you can also faint in north south when you pass the shoulder line. So there's fainting in multiple stages of through paths. We don't have to just faint in front of someone. There's many times you have to create tension in the legs. Move, got to move people around much easier. Okay, but just basic fainting in front of a person. There are three major kinds of faints that we can be looking at. One is a throwing faint where I just throw my partner's legs side to side and throw one side to the other side and I just use that to create tension. The other is shuffling faints where I shuffle side to side and the third is switching faints where I switch my feet. And we can use these all in combination. I have to use one of the other. We use all in combination depending on my partner's reactions. So let's take a look at these. A throwing thing is what I step in my inside my into my partner's legs and I can be either a front of my partner like so or we can walk to an angle. And now from here we can throw our partner's legs from side to side where we can faint in one direction like so. Now she creates tension and I throw the other way. So I can step in and I just go in. I just move my partner's legs around. I just give small fast twitch movements. And move my head offline. My head center. My head moves offline and one direction and the legs go in the opposite. If I'm at an angle already, just bring legs towards me. My head moves as my legs as my hands go on the other direction. That big movement is just. This cool create tension in your partner's legs. Another way of fainting is shuffling where I physically just shuffle from side to side. This can bind with a throwing. Will allow you to faint and start creating tension in your partner's legs. And I can go, you know, have to faint and shuffle the same distance every time. I can give a small shuffle and then a big shuffle. And then we go. So eventually, I'm shuffling, shuffling, shuffling, shuffling and now I step past my partner's legs. We're past the legs. The third is a switching faint, okay, where I switch my legs as I faint. This once, a little bit tricky and can easily confuse a talented opponent. When I step with my right leg forward, she knows subconsciously. And I'm looking to pass her right soft. Why is this? If I step, my right leg forward. And I take a step to her left hip here. I expose my center line and she can dominate this space between my knees and throw a lot of noshy drummers. So if I go in and I step in this direction, I widen the space between my knees and I expose this space here. So now she clears the hands. She enters into my legs. This is no good, okay. So when I come in, she knows that if I try to pass her left and I'm right leg lead, this is a mistake on my part. And now she has all kinds of entrances into offense. So subconsciously, good player will know if I come in, high my hands. And I have a right leg lead, I'm passing to her right side because now when I cross that, I minimize the space between my two knees. Now she has to enter into my legs. She can't use any straight-hushy drumming entrances. And I can sort out like in my partner, okay. So if I'm rightly forward, she knows I'm passing right. To use a switching thing, where if I want to pass to my partner's right, I step in left lead forward, like so. And now from here, I make a faint like I'm going to throw my partner's legs to her right and pass to her left. So I go to step with my left left and I go to faint and I throw like so. My partner gives me a reaction and creates tension in the legs and a feet go to face me or her knees go to face me like so. The second I see that, I just quickly switch my feet. And as I switch, I pass in the up to direction. Now she has to face me. We switch our feet, we use a switching thing to switch from one side to the other. So I create the illusion of passing left, I step in, left foot. Now as I go to throw, I go to step. She thinks I'm passing left. But I passed right. So she thinks I'm passing left. But I passed right. She thinks I'm passing left. But I passed right. So I step in like so, I go to throw. And now I just have to my partner's hip line. She knows I'm going to pass left. As she goes to face me. She adjusts for this. And now. I pass the opposite side. So switching faint combined with these strong things. So I go to step to one side and plant here. I'm playing lessly far. I come in. I come out throwing. I'm shuffling. And then I switch. So we can create tension with these three things. A partner goes to react. And she's like, man, it's just as terrible. She doesn't know where I'm going. And then we're passed at J point. We create tension. At least I'm getting past. My partner said one on either side. So basic things in front of our partner. We have throwing things. And we combine them with shuffling things and switching things.",

        "text": "Okay guys, so what we're going to cover in this first part of our series is control. Control is the most important part of guard. There's control in someone and then there's attacking someone. Without control, it's very dangerous to attack because when you have no control, you're vulnerable to attacks from your partner. It's so important to understand how to control someone. So, I wanted to find control quickly for you guys before moving on. I used a lot of terminology in GJ tip and I think it's very important that you understand these terms. Just to then be your understanding of guard will be complete. Okay, because I don't want to just give you a tax to do. I want to give you a full understanding of how to control your opponent. How to attack your opponent. Everything about the guards, I need you guys to understand. Okay, so let's define control. There's two parts of control that we're going to cover in this series. There's framing your opponent and then there's hooking your opponent. Framing your opponent is when you make a distance from your opponent where they can't come into you. If you have no frames on your opponent, they can pass your guard, right? They're not. You have no frames. I'm going to cover frames and hooking separate, but I just give you a quick. I put over view of what we're going to be covering because each of these concepts, I'm going to explain how they apply to a knee shield like we're working. Okay, so a frame is distance management. We're keeping the distance from our partners. Hooking somebody is that opposite. We're actually keeping them from being able to back away from us, okay? Both are essential in us playing guard because both are a part of our overall objective of control, right? And without control, it's very dangerous to attack our partner. So the first part of this whole series is going to be learning how to control the person. Because the first step of guard is control. The second step of guard is attacks. Once we have full control of our partner. I just wanted to give you guys a quick overview of this and now we're going to get into frames. But again, there's two parts of control, frame and hooking, and we're going to cover each element of that now. Okay guys, so now we're going to cover the first part of control. Like I discussed previously, the first part of control in guard is for art frames. What is a frame? A frame is your distance management. Your frame prevents your partner from putting all their weight onto you and smashing you, right? In guard frames are the most important thing. Wow, if I have no frames, my partner is enough, right? And I have no frames on my partner. Look, she gives not. There's no frames. So when I play guard, all I'm thinking about an issue is how I could place my body on my partner to keep a wall from stopping her from passing my guard. Okay, this is the most important thing because think about it. The more frames I've heard on my partner, her her to pass my guard, she has to win each individual frame. If I have, if I have one frame on her, she removes it, she has to make her. If I have two frames on her, now she has to remove one, just remove the second, and then she can pass my guard. So my objective, what I'm playing guard, is to make as many things on her body as possible. Because once I make all these things on her body, they will eliminate, you will make it so much harder for her to pass. Because she has to start individually eliminating each of my frames. And the concept we're going to learn in this series and all of our, because GG2 isn't just one specific thing. We're doing so many things from everywhere the same. Okay, there's so many general concepts. Okay, and what you're going to learn is how when they eliminate one of our frames, all other frames are what's going to help us redeem that frame. Okay, that's how we play guard always. I'm going to get over, I'm going to go over soon how we're going to frame and be healed. Okay, but right now I'm discussing our objective with frames. We're just placing our body on our partner to keep them from passing our guard. If we have no frames, they will pass their guard. Okay, so I want that to be your mindset when you're playing guard. I'm going to place as many parts of my body on my partner to make it way more difficult to pass the guard. Because when you're on top, all you want to do is remove everything from you to pass the closer distance. Okay, and now in the next video I'm going to cover are the most important parts of the body to frame. Okay, there's very specific spots that I'm focused on when I'm framing my partner. Okay, and also what I need you guys to understand is overall, the frames in place on our partner is our foot. That's the definition of four digits. The four is the overall accumulation of frames. For my foot to be strong, I need to have this strongness for this possible. Strong frames have nothing to do with your strength and your body. This strong frames have to do with your body position. All I do is study body position because the angle of your hips, how you're holding the collar, how you're angleing yourself is all what makes your frames strong. What happens is when you're playing guard, the second you have one week frame on your partner, your partner could expose it and take advantage of it and break your foot. Think of it as a fort and there's a week point in the fort, they finally point and they attack that part, collapsing your overall fort, even though other parts of it was strong. Okay, so my goal in guard is to completely eliminate any weak points in my fort, totally with my frames. So each individual frame I have to obsess about to make perfect. So I'm just giving up with all of you of our objectives. We're going to learn how to frame our opponent and I'm going to show you now the most important frames we're going to use in this series. And in guard general. So now we're going to cover our most important frames in guard for you to think of. Okay, this is so important to understand because these specific parts of the body are what's going to stop your partner from being able to perceive over. If I place my foot in the other parts of the body, if I focus on other parts of the body, I wouldn't be framing the correct one. So, but I want to show you is the most two important frames I'm going to be covering for you guys, there's a tip. There's one on the hip bone, the interior severe, the spine, this frame is so important. Okay, because every time she frames us, I cannot bring my body forward. If she was on my leg for example, let's say she's bring my leg, look how I can bring my hip forward. And look how he's our person. Whatever she's right on my hip bone, I can't come forward. If she were both in my hip bones up, I cannot come forward. You say, so we're always thinking about how we can frame this hip bone, what we're playing with. Because every time you go frame this hip bone, I cannot proceed forward. Meaning, look how I cannot bring my body forward. If she was on my leg, if she was on my ribs up, look how I can come forward. Look how I can come forward. Look how I can come forward, you say. So it's super important to understand that we're framing right on the hip bone. Okay, that the first frame you're going to learn in controlling the guard. The second frame we're going to learn, which accomplishes the same exacting, used to armpit. Okay, every time she frames my armpit naturally, every time she frames my armpit and pushes pressure here, I cannot proceed forward again. Oh, wait, I like to explain this to students, it's seen like X. So she's in signal like X on me. Here, right? If she's controlling the correct leg, her foot is right on the anterior superior X on the knee bone, right? When I remove the hip bone, look how I can pass the guard. Because there's nothing stopping my hip bone coming forward. But watch, if I remove the hip bone here, the grip from my hip, and she places her arm in my armpit like so. Now look at her arm. Look how I can not bring my hip forward again. I can go this way. But my hip does hip go forward. Why? Because the armpit. Okay. So if I can't proceed forward, I'm going to have super efficient frames on my partner. Okay. And this is the way that if you're smaller than your partner, that you could control them without them coming forward. Okay. When I find in Europeans about a year ago, I bought some important accounts. And I placed my feet in his armpits when I played guard. And that stopped him from being able to get over my legs. Because I made my legs perfect on his body. But if you couldn't come forward, so he stopped. Okay. That's so important to understand, guys, honor it and hit. Those are the two most important frames in guard that we're going to cover. And now I'm going to show you how we're going to do this in the shield. I'm going to give you guys each individual. I'm going to have a lesson for each individual of part of the shield. Just so you guys have all understanding how to control the partner. Because in the shield, your body leg, your partner's over one of your legs. So it's super important to learn how to frame. You need to be able to frame the shield to play it. It's the most important part of the shield. Okay. So we're going to get into that now. But again the tip on those are the two most important frames we're going to be covered with. Okay, guys. So now we're going to cover is what we're going to be doing in this series. We're playing knee shield. knee shield is a form of half guard. So there's open guard where my legs are outside my partner, right? And I'm not open. There's closed guard where again my legs are outside my partner. And then there's knee shield. Where one of my legs is inside my partner's legs. Okay, there's many guards where you have one of your legs inside your legs. knee shield is one of these guards. Okay. What is good about knee shield? What's bad about knee shield? The good thing about knee shield is I'm able to control my partner from getting away from it. I haven't covered helps yet. I haven't covered the other part of this yet. All we're talking about is frames. But because she's over one of my legs, I'm able to keep her from backing away from me. The cannabis is because I'm able to keep her from backing away from me, which I'm going to cover. She could put more pressure on her. She could use more pressure to comfort. So how I frame her is going to be the most important part of knee shield. It's way more crucial for me to be framing her correctly either. Then if I was an open guard. If I was an open guard, she's not already over one of my legs. She doesn't have a connection over my leg. She has to put one of my legs down and then get the half of it. And now she can start putting pressure on me to pass my guard. Right? So what I'm going to show you now is the first leg I used to frame my partner. This is the most important part of knee shield. If you get this down, you'll be able to clean knee shield perfect on everyone. Because no one will be able to crush you before. Okay? So what I'm going to do is, like I explained, there's two parts of the guard on the knee balcony. There's the armpit and there's the hip over here. And these are the two types of knee shield, right? There's a low knee shield like this and then there's the upper knee shield like this. Okay? In this series, I'm covering the upper knee shield. I personally prefer to always play upper. I want to show her upper body at all times. Okay? I don't like when my partner puts weight on her knee here. There's some mission exposure. There's many different things I can do in this scenario. But how I play in a perfect world. And I always want to play like this is hooking her shoulder, play on her shoulder like so. Okay? So like I said, the hip and the armpit are the two places we're going to be in the shield. Okay? For this first one, I'm going to show you how to play in the shield. So what? I'm going to be here. Again, we're not going to continue to my line yet. Okay? I'm going to be covering every single thing possible with this bottom, like also. And this arm, and every other part of my body. But right now, all we're covering is this left leg, how I'm going to be using it for this year. Okay? So what are we going to do? I'm going to do something. I'm going to show you how to set up a knee shield with my top leg. All I'm going to do is I'm going to take my left arm. So like I explained before, am I going to hit all of the armpits? Pretty much for it. I'm going to take my hand. I'm going to put my fist in the armpit like so. Look how my gut goes, or right in the armpit. So really show it for at least. You see how stops are from bringing the shoulder forward. Right? So now what am I going to do? I'm going to reinforce my frame on my partner punching away her shoulder. Put my leg as well in the same spot. So there's two ways that we're going to be legally able to place my foot or my leg. What is going to do with my shin on our armpits and comfort? The second will be my toes. And the toes will have a purpose later on in the series. Right? So for now, all we're going to be doing is to shin. And the shin is sufficient control. It's perfect control. Okay? So basically what I'm doing is every time I'm here, I just need to keep my partner shoulder back. If my partner shoulder comes forward, she could generate pressure on me. She could put more pressure to pass my gut. So all I want is to do is think about bringing this shoulder, punching her shoulder away. And now all I'm going to do is take my shin and put her shoulder. What I want you to see is how when I look this shoulder come forward, look how my shin stops her from coming forward. So I'm sorry my fist, so punch come forward. So I'm sorry my fist and look. When I'm framing her, notice how when I'm here, I'm also who my fist right on her collarbone. Why? Because a collarbone is directly afraid. Every time you're trying to grab a collar, anytime you're framing your partner, you're looking to go on a bone. The concept of bone for soft tissues, I talk about it every one of my DVDs, and basically when your soft tissue, she can bury my shin because there's nothing framing her. When you're on the bone, she can not bury my shin. Because she's directly a ball on her. Okay. So always we're aiming for them, the bone on her arm, right? So like push your shoulder on top, right? Knuckle is on her shoulder. Right on the collarbone, right? And not on her neck. Now when you sit on a hook, your shoulder is up. When my shin, right on her body, I'm going to talk about my foot, a little bit later in the hooking part of the series, right now we're framing all I'm doing is placing my shin on her shoulder. And I'm raising my shin in a way that when you come forward and forward, she can not bring her shoulder forward. If I didn't raise my shin this way, look how my leg bears. So look at my knees below my leg. When the hoists are buried. But look how when I bring my knee up, knuckle forward. Look how she cannot come forward. So I'm my fist, and my shin, the stop of the knee forward, they show you come forward, they show you. You see how she cannot come forward, they show you the guys. So all the advanced things I'm going to show you, all these crazy things I'm going to show you. If you cannot do this, and you skip this second, you will have trouble with everything. Okay, I'm telling you, this is the most important part of the knee shell, at everything I'm showing you, is this hooking the shoulder relation with my knee up and framing the shoulder. Okay, if this shoulder is forward, look how my knee starts collapsing. Look how she starts putting pressure on me. Look how she gets her feet in things and passing my gun. But if I'm able to keep my fist on her shoulder, like so, I put nothing thing. Look how she cannot come into me. Okay. That's why I'm covering this how and this is the so important thing. Look it also be like this, which will learn in other sections why I do this. But basically the concept here is you're replacing your hand with your leg. We're using our hand works, and we're reinforcing it with our other hand. I mean with our other leg. You see, both things are helping me, keep her shoulder back. Okay. So this is the first lesson you're learning on framing. This is our first frame initial, our shin hooking the shoulder by so. Not hooking, just frame your shoulder. We're not hooking yet. Okay. We're not using our hook on the shoulder. All we're doing is putting our shin on shoulder. Okay. I'm not always hooking her shoulder. I'm moving. I'm typically with my shin like so. And hooking will be in another scenario, and I'm going to show you that briefly. Okay. So for now, we're here. All you need to do is, we're here helping her. And get to the knee show and push the shoulder by hook. Then we stop here. My fist on top of my knee. My knuckles pushing. And my hand right on top of my leg. Okay. This is all we're doing for now. Don't worry about your hooks. Don't worry about anything. All we're doing is framing. And again, the definition of framing. Keeping your partner from coming in. We're not keeping them from back in the way. Just keeping them from coming in. All right. Okay. Okay, guys. So now what I want you guys to do is, I want you guys to practice this trip. I'm not using my bottom leg at all. The partner top is just going to be trying to pressure this shoulder into it. And you're just going to frame with your fist on the collar. Because we've got the collar right. We're going to place our shin right on the shoulder. And they're going to try to be into it. All you're going to do is just frame that shoulder. And all that partner is doing is really natural. They're not doing anything else. This is just going to teach you to be correct. Because if they're driving all the way forward and you're able to keep them from coming forward, you're framing correctly. Okay. Like I explained before, this is so important. This particular way I'm grabbing for shoulder. I'm framing for shoulder. So I need you guys to get this down. Okay. So I'm here. I'm not going to tear my bottom leg. Just leave it in the air when floating here. It doesn't matter what you're doing. If I'm like don't worry about the person passing, all they're allowed to do is bring your shoulder forward. Here. Bring your shoulder forward. Yeah, you say. So I have to stop it from doing that. All I do is I keep my hand. I go my thumb inside with four fingers right on the collar. I'm punching it shoulder away. I put my shin right on top. Raising my lap with me. Okay. You're going to ask your partner to come into you. Okay. And what you're eventually going to be doing is letting go of this grip. And your leg is going to be doing it. But for now, we're just doing this. So come into it. Okay. At the end of the show again. So come into it. But how my shin is looking here? I'm punching her away. And now she can come into it. Right? So you're trying to drop her shoulder off. If I remove my leg and my fist. Look how she falls for you. So now. See. And on my side, on my right hand. Right? On my side. I'm just playing here. And look how this is protecting me. Look how my right hand is going to be free. Look how I left hand. And let you be free. It's going to be so many things. But if you cannot do this. These shows going to be very dangerous because they. You're not going to be able to keep the distance, right? So our first frame is always here. Right? On the right. Okay. Punching. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is the first you'll initial that. What you guys practice. You know what the show is a while, but I just need you guys to have this understanding. Your party. Try as far as they can. The dry that shoulder. You're just framing the shoulder. Okay. This is going to teach you the perfectly. Use your. Neatial on their shoulder. Okay. So that's working. So now we're going to discuss the second part control. Obviously I have not discussed anything with my legs. I'm only focusing right on her upper body. Which is the first part controlling someone. Right? So we discussed framing our partner. Now we're going to discuss something else. We're going to discuss what is a hook. A hook is whenever I stop my opponent from being able to back away. So all I can is so far was when they try to come into you, putting pressure into your body. You're able to frame them from coming into you. Now we're going to learn is how to keep them from burning away. Okay, because this is the second part of control. You have to frame and keep them from getting away. You have to control your partner's stuff. They can't back away and they can't come in. Right? So this is super important to understand. And how I like to explain a hook is with a grip actually. Why? Because look how similar a hook of grip is with control. So my partner comes into me like so. Here and she's trying to put it to me, but no I'm pushing her away with my fist. I'm framing her right so she can't throw into me. But the second she starts back in the way. Look, I want you guys to see something. See how my finger. If my finger is in this line and she backs away, she is able to move her body back. Why? Because I'm not going to be behind her to keep her in. So watch what happens when I go to the collar. And I mean my four fears behind this collar now that way. Look how I have volume behind her to keep her from backing away. Again, right? No volume. They keep her back away with pressure falls away. Look how she's able to back away. Do you see that? So every time we're poking someone, again, with the other body, let's say I'm pushing her away. Back away? Now off. Back up. Look how I back around her mouth. Now she can't back away. This is the definition of a book. A book keeps the partner from being able to back away. Okay? This is so important for us because what happens is when your partner tries to drive into it. They feel the frame. In their mind, if they're not trying to force through a frame, they're going to think, okay, instead of driving through the frame, I'm going back away and then come back in. To try to change it and go the frame. Changing angles is one of the biggest things in you, right? So while I'm here, and I push her away, so go the frame. And she backs right now. Now I'm going to try to frame this early and bring your shoulders back in. But that should feel like frame. Right? So I lost my next finger when she backs away. But now when she backs away, that way. Look how I want to do like work fingers behind the collar. She can no longer back away. Because I have volume behind the collar. I have volume behind her back back left. If I want that volume behind her back left, that is what a hook is guys. That is all a hook is intuitive. It's just having volume behind the thing that you're trying to back away. And it keeps them from being able to back left. Okay? The biggest thing I need to understand is why this is important for us to understand and bring you before understanding and cooking. If I want to teach her from back to the leg. But I am real crazy. I'm going to keep her from back your legs and back left with it. Back left? Not gonna take it. Look how I can't stop her. I'm going there now. If I just hook her. You see the difference. So I need to be able to frame her and come inside and back you away at the same time. At the monitor or bull. That is the definition of control. Framing and cooking at the same time for full control of her partner. Right? So that is what I need to be guys to understand right now. We're stopping her from backing away and we're stopping her from killing him. Creating this middle ground where she's stuck. Okay? This is why we got a full control of her partner. Okay? So now we're going to go on to the next part of the series. Which I want to show you now how I use my hook on her upper body. Then we're going to get into the lower body. But right now I want to just have. I want you guys to have perfect understanding how I'm using my upper body control on her. That's what we need. The biggest difference in the start. So now we're going to show you how we're going to use our top like any shield now to monitor our partner from backing away. Okay? So I'm going to hear. And let's see if there's learned how I use my hand to have button behind my partner. So they can't back away. Now you're going to learn how to use your foot to do the same thing. Okay? But first I want you to see something to come into me. I'm afraid of her. But they feel the frame. They want to back up now. Back up. Now come into me what you're shoulder down. You see? This is very important. I understand this. So when she comes into me it frames. I beat the collar. And my four fingers are going to drop around her collar. So I have to follow you behind the grip. Now to back away from the collar. Look how many would it super backing away from just my hand. Right? But again, I'm using my light here. Why would I use my light the most in patient work? So I'm going to take my toes now. And I'm going to wrap it behind your back. So it's super close. Look how when I got my toes behind her back. You hang her back back with it. She cannot back away. So I have like four fingers in her collar. Putting the body behind them. Look how many four fingers in her collar. Pretty body behind them. I'm just showing you a box. And you say. And my toes wrapping her arm. Now she can't back away. So now it's the back of that. So this is how we're hooking our partner with upper body. We're free. So come in to me. Now start the back away. My foot is there tomorrow from back away. And my knuckle here. Pulling her in. Look how she can't back to the shoulder. Look how she's stuck. Look how she comes forward. She's free. Look how she backs away. She's free. Now I would define this as control. Right? Because I have a book elements of distance management. And her backing away. So I have the hooking. And I have the framing at the same time. So this is what both control is. Okay. So now this is what we covered in this one. Now I'm going to quickly give you a draw. Just the boxes poking at shoulder. And then we're going to start getting into the body like. Okay. Like I said, we're breaking this down. Each part of the body is specific. Because I want you to have perfect body position for each part. If I quickly did this, skimming it without explaining this, you would not have perfect body position. Okay. So I want you guys to really practice these individual parts of me show. Okay. So before we drill framing our partner from them coming into us, right? Now we just learn the hooking. Let's keep them from backing away. So now we're going to combine the two together. We're going to drill them. Come in and tell us. And then back and go. Okay. So watch what you're doing. The jokes are going to be like this. Again. I won't care about how I'm using my bottom right now. Okay. I'm going to be explaining everything about the bottom. Right now we just focus on this shoulder, which is the most important part of our control in the initial initial. Okay. So all that's going to happen is you're going to come into me. I'm going to frame your shoulder. Again, if I have no four fingers behind the volume of her collar, if I don't have any hooking on her back, back with me, look how she could back her shoulder with me. Okay. So all I have to do now is, which is framing commitment, all I'm going to do is I'm framing. As I feel she's back in the way, I'm going to place my four fingers behind the collar. Like so. So now I'm going to be behind her collar. I'm going to place my toes on her back. Now back with. Look how she cannot back away. Now coming to me. Look how when she started coming into me, I'd frame again. Now that way. Now come to me. Now that way. Now come to me. So that's all this deal is going to be on here. She comes into me. Wow. Come into pressure pressure. It's hard again. Now that way as hard as you can. Look how she can. I'm able to have a full control over now. This drill will guarantee that you're playing the knee shield correctly with the control. Okay. So I need you guys to just drill this a little bit, practice it. The person coming in, the person back me up. Don't have any change angles. Don't have the move at all. Because right now, all we're doing is focusing on the upper body. This up. Every part of the body, I'm going to give you guys the perfect body. This is the perfect body position for it. So right now, we just learn how to have a whole complete control of this shoulder, right? Every time they back away, we put. For we get volume behind them so they cannot back away. Every time they come into us and frame our frames, hit or armpit. Like always. And right now we're armpit. Okay. So we're just going to continue from here. But I just wanted you guys to do this. You'll quickly make sure you understand how to frame her. [Music] So now we're ready to discuss hooks in each shoulder with our legs. Okay. So we have discussed already how to control the upper body, controlling the shoulder, right? Because the armpit is one of the most important frames for us on the bottom. And also hook it, right? So now we're going to learn is how we use our initial hook as a frame as well as a hook, right? And I also want to explain to you all the different length positions we're going to cover in this series. And how they're all basically the same, just altering the angle of our toes. Okay. So first thing I'm going to show you is the inside. So I already show you, right? We've done this shoulder here. I'm ready to help her body. And I have my hook on her shoulder like so. So now she comes in to me. She can't. She backs away. But now I'm going to show you my bottom like it's going to go inside. But all I need you guys to understand about when I go inside this game size, that's what you can see. All I want you guys to see what I'm doing is I put my heel in the middle of the lower and upper part of her leg. So I want to show you guys what is it under her. And the other hook is whatever my hand is in the lower and upper part of her leg. She has two parts of her leg, right? Why it under is so effective is because it controlled both parts of her leg. So when I'm here at least you know all I'm doing first is putting my heel in the middle of her lower and upper part of her leg. Okay. So now I want to explain to you this. The difference between each shoulder and the personality but because of my partners on her knees, where we're doing is notice my heel remains the same. I'm going at least my toes on the lower part of her leg. Like I just explained this to you parts of her leg. Whatever my partner is on your knees, I'm controlling the lower part of her leg. Whatever my partner goes on with me, look what I did. My heel remains identical, right? But now I'm no longer hooking the bottom part of her leg. I'm going at least my foot on the top part of her leg in reverse valley above, right? So go down here. Look at my heel remains the same on pole. So in knees you're on hooking the lower part of her leg, which we're covering this series. When she brings her leg up, look now I put my foot on the upper part of her leg. Because her leg is off the floor. The lower part of her leg, the upper part of her leg is off the floor. You see, when the lower part of her leg is on the floor, we hook the knee show with my foot. When she takes it off, we're in reverse valley. So this is the first thing I want you to understand. Now I also want you to understand. The other part of the series, we're actually going to be doing this. Not only will I be initial, I'll have a butterfly leg like so. And I'll have a reverse butterfly hook like so. Again, following the same concept, look. The heel remains identical in pole, right? Because this, the reverse butterfly hook, I'm hooking the lower part of her leg. The butterfly hook, I'm hooking the upper part of her leg. Look now my heel remains in the same place for pole. So I'm here in each show, which we're going to be doing this whole series. I've never been shown on her. I've got a leg collar, I bring my foot in. I'm just focused right now. I'm putting my heel in between the low and upper part of her leg. Like this. Now I realize, okay, she's on her knees. What does that mean? That means I'm grabbing the lower part of her leg on my toes. You see how I'm grabbing the lower part of her leg on my toes? Now what this is going to make me do today. Because I'm grabbing her leg. So if I wasn't grabbing her leg out of here, just run her feet around and walk around me. Look how she's able to walk her legs. How do you do the fine control before? We define control by stopping her from coming into me and backing away. If I'm only here, she could start backing away. Really, it's back as well. You see? Because she's able to back away. Watch when I put something behind her. I put my toes behind her. Now that way. I do something in here. I'm backing away. Come into me. Now I'm making this wall under children. So as you guys can see, I have a bulk control of her leg. And when I grab my toes around the lower part of her leg, it stops from being able to run away from me or continue as well. So I wanted to give you guys a understanding of why we're hooking the knees. The knees should come on the lower part of her leg. She's honored. That's why we're doing this. If her knee comes up, we're a reverse belly man. Okay. Also, we're going to be covering this series by accident. The butterfly hook will be involved in the knee shield system. And the reverse butterfly hook. And what do they have identically in comment with the reverse? Not like the hook and the knee shield. My heel remains the same in bulk. Just controlling the lower and upper parts of the leg are different. That's the only thing guys. So I wanted you guys just to get an understanding of both of these things. Do you see how I'm backing my leg around her? All I'm doing is I'm here. I'm getting her shoulder. I just put my toes in. Right here, she's honored. I just brought my toes right over the leg like so. Okay. This is all we're doing for now. Okay. I just wanted to give you an understanding of the hooks. It's so important. Yes. So now I'm going to give you a quick drill to practice hooking our partner. I wanted to see how completely controlling our partner now. And now we already have two parts of our body controlling the partner. Technically three. But my left head is going to be leaning at shoulders soon. So right now we're going to be having two parts of our body completely dominating her. Right. As I explained previously, this whole series I'm going to show you how to have perfect control with every part of our body or two legs and our two arms. Right. So watch how I'm going to control. The Jo is going to be a solos. I'm here. I'm going to just like the previous job where I'm putting your shoulder. So come in to me. I'm punching her shoulder. I put, notice I'm on my right head. Right. I'm not square. I'm on my right head. I'm punching her shoulder right now. Come in to me. And now I'm putting my foot, my leg. You hurt her shoulder as well. So she's trying to come in to me. She can't. She tries to back away. I make body with my core fingers behind the collar. I hook her back. And I'm back. She can't back away. So now I'm going to add this to this. This bottom leg is going to go inside her leg. And now it's going to happen. It's going to go in between the lower and upper part of her leg. But I want you to just focus on your heel. Get it inside. Not your toes. So you're going to go like this. I'm going up and shoulder her legs up. I'm going to go inside my leg. You'll meet you in the lower legs. Now all I'm going to do is place my heel right here. And between her legs. Like so. Now that my heel is inside the lower and upper part of her leg. I'm going to just place my toes to the lower part of the leg. Okay. Now you can go on one knee. Please. So you sound like heels already in the spot. Now it would just go on top of the leg like so. You say you sound like down. Lower her leg. You see how it doesn't change either direction. Okay. For this, you know, obviously we're initial. So her knee is down. I'm just cooking. But all I want you to bring to think about when you initially get to the knee. She'll put in the heel right in between the lower and upper part of the leg. It is identical to under. Right. Because what is under her family. And under her family is my hand in between the lower and upper part of her leg. So now I'm just using my leg to under her leg. Right. Now once I'm here, I put my toes right behind her lower part of her leg. I'm framing up with me. Now that's what? Now I'm cooking her leg. Okay. This is all I want you guys to work now. This now already. We already established two parts of full control on my partner. Which already is going to give you an amazing success in knee shield. Right. But now once we start adding in the other elements, you're going to see how much better you're taxiing in get. Because remember what we said. To attack her partner, we need full control. Guard your two things. Control it and attack you. To attack knee control. Once we have full control, our attacks become easy. You're easier. Right. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. So this is the next row. Just putting her leg in. Okay. So this is the next row. So this is the next row. So this is the next row. free mark on her shoulder, we're ready to begin learning where what I'm going to do next. What I'm going to discuss next is how I play on the cross cup. Okay. Like I explained our goal is to establish as many frames as I can on my partner. What I also explained is whenever I'm on a bone, I have way better frame than being on soft tissue. Okay. Now when I'm going to explain is how when I'm able to have full control on one part of my partner's body, using two things, I can let go of one of those things once I pull control and use that thing now in another place. Okay. In other DVDs, I say I'm now free for actually our activities with this thing. So how I describe it in my other DVDs, I describe it as you're using, you replace your whatever you're using and then what you replace it with another part of your body, it opens you up to use that in another part of your body. Because our goal is to do is full body efficiency, right? I want to be able to use my body as efficient as possible to the highest percent. Okay. So what I just showed you guys before. I mean this position, now I'm looking here for, right? Because we just learned this, my this and hand, my leg and knuckles are framing her so she can't come in and she can't back away because I'm looking. I feel I have enough control of her shoulder, I'm able to let go of my hand now. Why? Because come into me, back away. Now back where you're like, you see. So I'm now able to control her because of this bottom hook because of this I do things hooking her and I do things framing her at once. So now this hand is free. This hand is free for our activities, okay? So in this series what we're going to learn about this hand. Mostly in the series we're going to learn the color. We will be grabbing the cross lead at frames, but for now all we're going to be doing is grabbing the color. So if we're following my rules before, how to frame my partner, where is my hand going to be? It's going to be directly on the color bone on the bone, right? So not completely. Look, I'm taking away another thing, come to me, now come to me, okay? So now I'm directly on the color bone, but I was on the soft tissue of come to me, look how my wrist starts collapsing because there's no frame on her, now come to me. So now let me ask you, can you feel like there's a wall on you right now because of this frame, like from you coming in and then this thing, so three most other. Yes, there's nothing she cannot come in, right? So now, as you see, we are already established somewhat control of my partner, right? And also what I want you to see is right now the function of the cross color is just primarily on the frame, right? What we're going to learn to do with the cross color, like I explained other series, is spine and affiliation. Using my doubles on her neck, we're going to be learning to bring her neck down, possible submission exposure, right? There's many different things, framing her away, so come to me, okay? Pushing her this way, that is what's amazing on the color. Let me Mr. Rector had an interaction, and every time we put the Mr. Rector's spine in the direction of her body, it alters her face between each leg, which are going to be discussing balance in a little bit. Right now, I'm here, framing her shoulder, we're just going to add in. What's like, \"Well control, and we're this grip, and I grab the cross color, great on her color, it's amazing.\" You see, I'm poking her bottom like, and I'm just in this spot. Whenever you're honking the bottom like, in your frame, you're not thinking about looking, all you're thinking about is your heel being in between the lower upper part of the leg. Then your heel will go every time, okay? So, okay, please. Permission me? I'm poking, I'm framing. Once I feel my frame is sufficient, I push her back enough, I twist and I can grab down the frame again. Okay. Now, let me do it. And now, my frame is all that's left, right? So now we're going to be learning what to do with the right here. But as you see, this is pretty much what we should. This right hand is going to be in many different places when I think you should. Okay, so there's not going to be one set rule for this. But for my guard, in general, this is my guard. I already have these many things left. One, two, my hook is another thing. Three. If I need to do my knee, which I'm only going to explain a little bit, I need to be on the outside of her body, will be your frame as well. But you see, guys, for her and past my guard now, it's going to be very difficult because she's going to have to remove my frames to pass my guard, but she's going to have a really hard time because I've so much control of her from backing away and coming in. So for her to remove my frames, it's going to be really difficult, guys. Okay. So now you're going to understand. Color group, we've got a right on the collarbone. Okay. That's what we're thinking about for now. Okay. We're hugging a leg, pretty darned. It's just like before. We're just replacing our knuckles that we're here to the cost collar. Now we need to go. So now we just discussed our hugging the leg getting the collar. Now we're ready to discuss how we're going to play knee show. Okay. So there's two worlds of knee show. Why do I keep everything in the world? If you're not familiar with my diabetes, every thing I teach, I always convince the two worlds. But because every time I do things into two worlds, it's either or independent on the scenario, I'll attack according to them. So in my mind, I make everything into two worlds. Once I know I'm in a certain world, I know all the steps and procedures I have to follow in that world. But then when they defend and give me the other world, I have my steps and procedures also to follow. So I always try to make this split between both worlds. Okay. And when you're going to notice this is when I'm playing knee show, there's two worlds always. But I'm here in knee show. And I'm initially starting here with my hip. My hip on the shoulder and the collar. There's what the first world is my head is more towards her shoulder. Right? And this arm is more forward. And this arm is more back. The second world is when I'm over here in knee show. My head is not facing her shoulder. And now I'll notice how this shoulder is more back. Both worlds will give me different opportunities to do things, right? Just so you understand, there's going to be many attacks on both worlds. Okay. And we're going to learn that every time we're doing one world, the partner might defend giving us the other. So it's going to be very important for me to understand which, what to do in the scenario, right? Because my start going through this shoulder, she might back, it's like, \"I'm going to show the fat. Now look around. I'm in this world now.\" Okay? Or, \"I'm here.\" In this world, she brings back shoulder to me. Now in this world. Okay? So what is this going to come down to? This is all going to come down to a million hip interactions. In the first world, the series we're covering the far side, the far side. Okay? This is the same side, and this is the far side. In this part of the series we're covering all far side stuff. Okay? So this two world, far side, same side we're covering far side, and first. So my objective to this series is always going to be getting my head to her shoulder, that far shoulder. Once I get my head to that shoulder, we're going to see how many opportunities present themselves. Okay? But also what I want you to know this, since we already learned about the hooking, notice where my knee is right now. When I'm in the same side of the knee, she'll, right? Look how my knee is outside her body, it's a frame. Notice when I go to that far side of the knee, she'll look how my knee starts moving inside her leg. And notice also how my toes that are in the knee show start are not as deep, so go to this one. So when I'm first in the knee, the same side, right? Here, look how my toes are deep and my knee is not in. When I start walking, look how my toe gets deeper in, and now my knee is inside. Now it's like I'm playing a butterfly hook on this leg at the same time as playing with the knee show hook. You say, so when I'm on the far side, my knee starts going in like a butterfly hook. You say, and that's going to be a new way of me controlling her, whatever I get to this far side. Okay? And when I'm here, my knee is shallow, so my foot is still in really tight. As I walk, if you'll get deeper and my knee starts going in, as if I had a butterfly hook. You see, I'm her butt right here. But now I have two hooks. One on the inside of this leg, and the other on this leg, which is going to help us tremendously in later parts of this series. Okay? So right now we're working the far side series in the show, right? And I just wanted to make you understand how when I angle myself, my knee starts going inside her legs. That's going to be tremendous for us in later parts of this series. And again, keep in mind when we're playing this, we're also going to have attacks eventually on that same time. Okay? So I want you to just have this understanding about to explain to you what pros I'm going to have, also being on this side with how I'm able to grab the collar and use my knee as well with the collar. Okay? So I just want to give you overview where in the world one of our knee show series, which is going to be the far side. Okay? Okay, guys. Now that we know that two worlds of knee show, what I want to quickly explain to you is how I angle around my partner. Like I just explained to you, I'm a knee start going inside when I start getting to that far side of knee show. It's important that you understand how I'm moving my body. Okay? So I'm here in knee show and I'm in this spot initially here, right? In my knees outside of your body, just like you learn. And when my knees outside of my body, my hook is strong, right? So I'm here. And I'm just controlling this leg for now. As you guys will see, as my head is facing the shoulder, my body knee going inside her, this leg gives me two controls of her, like, half. Because now this leg is going in as a bar of my hook. You see, what funny knee is here, it's talking her leg. The same leg as if I had a bar of my hook. It gave me the same functions. Because the bar of my hook, the pros of it are I could raise her leg, right? I can lift up her leg off the floor, right? Well, I have to do a hug from this far side. Come on, you need to raise her up. Exactly the same as a bar of my hook, right? So that's what you're really going to notice is going to happen as many knee goes under her leg. Okay. So now what I want you guys to see is how I'm angleing around her. This is a great drill gesture practice, but it's really simple. How are you going to see angleing around the person? I just want you to place your elbow on the floor. Okay. Once my elbow is on the floor and holding the collar, you're just going to move my body where my elbow is. Okay. So I place my elbow on the floor, holding the collar, I'm just going to move my body where my elbow is. Hold my elbow like so, and now I'm just going to punch my body. So I'm here. I pull my elbow forward, I'm just going to bring my body up, hold my elbow, close, bring my body right over my elbow. Now my hand is straight. Now my hand's on another shoulder. I'm going to go straight to see my feet movement. So here, I'm training. I just sit on my elbow, then I get to punch my body. So all you have to do is put your elbow forward and now you're bringing it in. I'm going to put my body where my elbow is. Right? So I'm here. I just put my body where my elbow is. And I end up right here. Okay. Now there's all the ways I can move my body as well. Using my toes on the floor to walk, you see I can scrub my shoulder. I can tuck my shoulder in instead of coming up, using my head. But for now, all I'm going to do is to work is elbow and floor move your body. Placing it right where your elbow is. And now I'm into this spot. Okay. That's all I want to explain this section. I just want to quickly Make sure you have an understanding of pain on yourself. Because it's like you just start, there's two or three shoulder. And if I can aim myself around her, I'm in the same side of your shoulder. Right now we're working far side of your shoulder. So it's very important to understand. You have to aim yourself to face this shoulder and then we're in the far side of your shoulder. So now what I'm going to discuss, I just discussed how we're using that collar as a frame. Now we're going to do exactly what we did on the other side, but we're going to do it on this side. Now I'm going to use my knee to reinforce my straight in my collar. So before we learn about it, when I'm here, I'm going to show there as my first straight in, right? And my hook, right? I bring my leg in and now she can't come forward or back. So then we move my hands to the cross collar, but now I'm going to bring this shoulder to me. I have to bring my hand, but why not? So bring this shoulder to me. Now look what I'm going to do. I'm just going to take my knee that below my shoulder. I'm going to bring it up like so. Now everything. Now I have my knee and my hand both supporting the frame on this shoulder at the same time. You see, so look out with more efficient. I'm using my body right now using my knee and my hand on this side. Completely the guarantee that you cannot be this shoulder forward, right? And then she started to bring the other shoulder forward to shoulders. Look how my hand is already there as well. So I'm always using my knee, whenever my partner brings this shoulder forward, to go right under my hand to frame this shoulder as well, okay? So we already learned hooking the leg like so, right? So we learned hooking the shoulder like so, framing here, switching the hair. Now what we're learning is how to frame with the collar here, and then they use our knee as well, whenever she comes in with this shoulder, so bring this shoulder forward. Now, all I'm doing is I take my knee, I sit right on top of, I sit right under, right? I sit my hand right on top of my knee, right? And that's all we're doing, it's a pillow bearer. I always define pillow bearer. All my DVDs as it's literally just sitting on top and it's an extra support. Now I have two parts of my body, framing one spot. Obviously generating more strength, and it's way more efficient using my body. So I'm here. I'm wearing the collar with my knee right under my hand, nothing to do. Notice my chin is like a bar, right, a concert chest as well. Reading, I'm going to be seeing the feeling stronger as well because she can't break any part of our upper body. And today, seven, two, you say, so we're first here. We're a bookie, we're here, I think you might need to not come in there. Now, both shoulders, being either shoulder forward, please. Both shoulders are completely stuck. And I have my hook under them. Okay, so I want you guys to add this in now. So we already, so practice hooking the leg, practice framing the shoulder, practice family collar. Now we're going to add in that knee across the body, put your chin across the body.",
