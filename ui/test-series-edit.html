    <h1>Series Edit Test</h1>
    <p>The series editing functionality is implemented in the UI but requires backend persistence.</p>
    
    <h2>Current Implementation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Series are auto-detected from video filenames</li>
        <li>✅ Series can be viewed with all metadata</li>
        <li>✅ UI has create/edit modals fully implemented</li>
        <li>⚠️ Backend accepts corrections but doesn't persist them</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How it works now:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Series are dynamically generated from video filenames each time</li>
        <li>The "Edit" button shows a modal with current series data</li>
        <li>Changes can be submitted but won't persist after restart</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>To make edits persistent:</h2>
    <p>The backend would need one of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A database to store series metadata</li>
        <li>JSON files to persist series corrections</li>
        <li>Integration with the existing state management system</li>
    </ul>
