# Next Session Plan

## **üéØ Primary Goals**
1. **Debug and fix LLM correction** - Identify why LLM calls aren't being made despite being enabled
2. **Integrate state management** - Implement resume capability to skip completed stages (audio extraction, transcription)
3. **Verify file output fix** - Confirm all videos now generate SRT/TXT files correctly

## **üìã Detailed Tasks**

### **Phase 1: LLM Correction Debug (30 mins)**
- [ ] Run system with debug logging to see LLM configuration values
- [ ] Check if transcription completion triggers LLM correction stage
- [ ] Verify LLM provider connectivity (LMStudio endpoint)
- [ ] Test LLM correction with a short transcription sample
- [ ] Fix any configuration or code issues preventing LLM calls

### **Phase 2: State Management Integration (45 mins)**
- [ ] Complete state management integration in processing pipeline
- [ ] Add state tracking for each processing stage
- [ ] Implement skip logic for completed stages (audio extraction, transcription)
- [ ] Add state persistence and recovery
- [ ] Test resume functionality with interrupted processing

### **Phase 3: Testing and Validation (15 mins)**
- [ ] Verify fix for missing SRT/TXT files
- [ ] Test full pipeline with state management
- [ ] Confirm LLM correction with token optimization (~70% savings)
- [ ] Validate parallel processing works correctly

### **Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Optional)**
- [ ] Add progress reporting for long-running transcriptions
- [ ] Implement cleanup of old state files
- [ ] Add processing statistics and time estimates

## **üîß Key Files to Work On**
- `src/processing.rs` - Integrate state management and fix LLM triggering
- `src/state.rs` - Complete state management implementation  
- `src/llm/correction.rs` - Debug and fix LLM correction calls
- `src/main.rs` - Add better configuration debugging

## **üéØ Expected Outcomes**
- ‚úÖ **LLM correction working** - Structured corrections with ~70% token savings
- ‚úÖ **Resume capability** - Skip completed audio extraction and transcription
- ‚úÖ **All file outputs** - Every video generates SRT and TXT files
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** - Robust error handling and state management

## **‚ö° Quick Wins**
- Debug LLM correction with existing transcription files
- Test state management with simple skip logic
- Verify parallel processing file output fix

## **Current Session Summary**

### ‚úÖ **Completed This Session**
1. **Fixed whisper.cpp JSON parsing** - Updated to handle multiple JSON formats from different whisper.cpp versions
2. **Implemented real-time whisper progress logging** - Shows transcription progress every 30 seconds with detailed output
3. **Fixed parallel processing bug** - Each video now gets unique temp directories to prevent SRT/TXT file conflicts
4. **Added comprehensive logging** - Both console and file logging with detailed debug information
5. **Identified LLM correction issue** - Added debug logging to diagnose why LLM correction isn't triggering
6. **Created state management foundation** - Comprehensive state management system ready for integration

### üîß **Issues Identified**
1. **LLM correction not triggering** - Despite being enabled by default, no LLM calls are being made
2. **Missing SRT/TXT files** - Fixed with unique temp directories (awaiting test confirmation)
3. **No state management** - Processing restarts from scratch each time (foundation created but not integrated)

### üìã **Current Status**
- ‚úÖ **Whisper transcription**: Working with real-time progress logging
- ‚úÖ **Audio extraction**: Working for all videos in parallel
- ‚úÖ **File output bug**: Fixed (unique temp directories per video)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LLM correction**: Enabled but not triggering (needs debugging)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **State management**: Foundation created but not integrated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance**: No resume capability, reprocesses everything
