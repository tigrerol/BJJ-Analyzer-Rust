1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,240
All right, guys, we're going to cover some secondary options for merversal use. Everything you've done so far has been very

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:25,880
heavy for follow-ups, from the inversions, but there's going to be always times where the diverges back at work and there's quite a few good

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,340
secondary options that we can use off of that's the right number of merversal use. So, going back to day and day of deep deep type

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:43,340
position, for me the way I think about, um, traversal hiva is, I want the weight of the far leg and really that's why I'm trying to achieve

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,680
a lot of things. And doing it again, we went over a scoop, I can use the scoop, but ultimately I do prefer getting the weight of the far leg.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,180
But when this front leg is very heavy, that's what I think about using the false three. So, false three, it's a pretty common position right now.

7
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,680
But when this leg is heavy, I think about going false three. So, I'm still going to kind of have my reversal that he will look in.

8
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,680
And I want my arm hugging my leg. It's saying when we talk about the forward where my elbow is close to my hip, I don't want him to get that knee in the back.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,680
Now, what I'm going to do is, with my top hand and hand, even if it's hands on the hip, it doesn't matter.

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,680
For free, I'm going to replace my leg over. So, what I'm doing is, I don't put the butterfly hip in.

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,680
To start, this is what a lot of people do. I find I don't have the space that throw my arm in after I do that.

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I do not want to grab first and then work my left arm. So, left leg is on. So, my grab first, I'm just inviting him to get chest of chest.

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:43,680
So, to smash me right here, and now I have no flexibility to get my leg inside. So, the order we do the false three is put over the top first, arm goes in,

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,680
and then the hip comes in. So, this is kind of what I've got, like the protocol of giving myself and it's a pretty successful.

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,680
So, I come underneath, I frame similar to what we go for the last of the version, and I'm just going to throw the foot.

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,680
So, I can step on this far claw. I want to create a lot of space between the back of my knee and his claw, like this.

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,680
The reason being is, I need my arm to go in here, right? I need it up space to my arm, go all the way inside.

18
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,680
So, once I get this, I'm going to use both legs, so my reverse leg even hook it, and by foot to make a little bit of space.

19
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,680
And see how my right leg occupies the space between his hamstring and his calf, I'm just going to replace that with my arm.

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,680
So, I kind of have that hook in, I extend, I drop, narrow close like this.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Now, I'll go deeper by left arm. Once I get that, I'm going to be locked, I'm going to figure four and grab my ankle and just use that to pound my legs inside.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,680
And again, I do find if I come back. So, I pull this in, if I pull this in first and I make space now, I have less space.

23
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I don't think I can jam that, trying to get this arm in here versus throwing the leg over, making space now, but big gap to go elbow deep.

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:06,680
I grab my ankle, grab my forearm, so even if it goes to clear my hook out, it goes to his hands, it's stuck because I have the script and I just pumble the toes inside.

25
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Now, once I have this, I'm ready to start to invert. So, I'm going to put my toes on the mat.

26
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Again, I check out the versatility, he will go out. I'm going to give Zing a little kick over my right shoulder, and my toes will go on the ground.

27
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,680
And my hips have to come up like this. See my butt, I'm down, I'm underneath him.

28
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Now, whatever the clip is like, I'm vegan. So, I'm making this script under his shin, with my right hand.

29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,680
That's going to help me create a distance to that between his hook and my hips.

30
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Overly this one, this one I need to do right here, so I'm nice and tight, I make that space.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,680
So, I make that space, I get this nice and deep right here. Now, chose on the mat.

32
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Now, look, as I'm here, I'm vegan being like, extend that I bring my knee behind, and now I've gotten my knee into this position.

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:07,680
From here, we have two options. If I feel like he's being heavy on me, my toes stay in the mat, and I roll my head to the outside, like this.

34
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
And I bring his foot towards my chest, this is a force of the role.

35
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Right here, I'm creating that like torque on his leg.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,680
And now, I have this arm underneath, I get to the top and the top.

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,680
And as the first option, I'll show that again.

38
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,680
When the falls reach, I'll always place it tight.

39
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Fraying it down inside, it's the amount I always inside my knee, so it's able to punch it under up.

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm in good position right here when I do this task before.

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,680
I'm focused over, I make space and drop the hook, or place it my arm.

42
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Figure four, chose, rolled inside, that toes in the mat, I got to get off of my shoulder.

43
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,680
I can't just pull this through. So, here, vegan.

44
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,680
And now, let's see my head all the way through.

45
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,680
And it's really fun when I do this, I pull a foot towards which there we go.

46
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,680
So, I create this band in this leg, so it's like, foot is rotating externally to his knee.

47
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,680
If I did this for a second, if I did this, if I did this, if I did this, if I did this and just stay here,

48
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
he won't do this knee into me.

49
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
I would just end that past smash.

50
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
So, it's really fun when I bring the foot with me as I do that.

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,680
So, I make that space, replace, drop, and chose, vegan.

52
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Now, I bring my head to the outside, we're going to bring the foot this way.

53
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
That's going to make a turn, and now, I get to my saddle.

54
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,680
So, sometimes, a little happiness.

55
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll feel my partner.

56
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:46,680
So, make my space, I'll feel my partner really sink in their knees and widen the space that way.

57
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,680
I feel like I feel like dropping right knee, dropping right knee.

58
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I feel like I can't get underneath from the same way.

59
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,680
When this happens, so my right hand is going to come out with a grip, but it kills your back post.

60
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
And I lift my head up like this.

61
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Now, I'm going to create that same torque by bringing this foot outside the line of his knee.

62
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I go my left shoulder, and then switch it around my legs.

63
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I'm doing side, now I'm on saddle.

64
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Same ways before.

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
So, just again with that.

66
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Make that space.

67
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Throw that over.

68
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
Boom.

69
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
I grab.

70
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,680
But I feel like I can't take them over like this.

71
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
But take this out.

72
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
I kill these grip.

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
I come up.

74
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Now, cross my ankles.

75
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
And I roll the opposite shoulder.

76
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
And that's going to rotate his foot outside the line of his knee.

77
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
And now, I'm going to suck.

78
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
All right.

79
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,680
So, from our reversal, heva.

80
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
He's heavy with the front leg.

81
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
Can't get his right back leg.

82
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Can't go from there.

83
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
That's going to throw the leg over.

84
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Putting the foot on the hip first.

85
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
Making space for the arm.

86
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
And then coming with the foot inside.

87
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
And we're going to fall straight.

88
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Back to fall straight.

89
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,680
We talked about the front leg heavy.

90
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
We're doing the fall straight.

91
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,680
The common reaction of this guy on a few different ways.

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
His knee is heavy with that front leg.

93
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
I make space.

94
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,680
I start the coming into the small recuperate here.

95
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
He kind of goes away.

96
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,680
He's kind of where everyone's doing.

97
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
So a lot of times, the person will do it.

98
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
He'll drop to that outside leg.

99
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
No search of rotate his knee.

100
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Almost outwards in this direction.

101
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
The more his knee comes to the back.

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
The more pressure he's doing when I do this.

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
The easier it is for me to get underneath him.

104
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Are you going to sit back and hold his knee up.

105
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,680
One of my looks starts to come out when it's hard to get up.

106
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,680
And a lot of times, you may even sneak by foot out.

107
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Now when it's kind of crappy because it should work.

108
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
You don't even have the way.

109
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
So when it's hard, we go back to the other version.

110
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,680
So when you think about way forward, fall straight.

111
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Way back.

112
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
Reverse on the heave up.

113
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
He has to sit straight back.

114
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
This happens.

115
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
I just have to switch.

116
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Reverse on the heave up and again.

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
A good inversion.

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
Right here.

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
So I'm making space.

120
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,680
We'll let it come over.

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm starting to pull this through.

122
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
He's just to sit back.

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
It starts to clear this foot out.

124
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
When this happens, the hook goes back in.

125
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I mean, just like that.

126
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,680
And then we'll back it all the options.

127
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
We'll force it out here.

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
So this is a really nice transition.

129
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
So he's having a year.

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
I can't hit my reverse of the heave up.

131
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Makes space.

132
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Start to go forward.

133
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm trying to get his leg in.

134
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
But he manages to pop the look out.

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Takes it out.

136
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Hook goes back in.

137
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
And we hit on the bridge.

138
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,680
So with this particular version, we do have to use the overreacting version.

139
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,680
It's very hard to get the scoop.

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Like in time to invert.

141
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
So it is important for this to do good at that.

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,680
But look how leg comes over.

143
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
I start to switch.

144
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
He's also popped in like that.

145
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
So he's back right away.

146
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
I hope goes in.

147
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I lift the foot off the mat.

148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Now I do my knee to chest lotion.

149
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
I get tight version.

150
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,680
And now we're back in our reverse of the heave.

151
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,680
So playing between the two differences of the weight is forward.

152
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
His weight is heavy.

153
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
It's heavy.

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm going to fall straight because that knee or leg is heavy.

155
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Easier to get my fall straight going.

156
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
The weight is back with the rest of the heave.

157
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,680
So when he switches his weight from one to the other, we go back and forth.

158
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,680
So even something like.

159
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
If I.

160
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
If he was on the knee, I'm starting to hit my reverse of the heave.

161
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
The same stuff to pressure me to make.

162
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
This is a great time to grow the leg over.

163
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
You go fall straight.

164
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Lift the toes up.

165
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
And then we have to be outside.

166
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Now we're in.

167
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Our fall straight situation.

168
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
So the.

169
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
It works in both directions going reverse of the heave or fall straight.

170
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
And fall straight.

171
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
So even you can get.

172
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,680
All right.

173
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
So.

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Another transition after we can do.

175
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
I feel like you don't want to use the reverse of the heave.

176
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Because we can go to.

177
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
I call it a new side.

178
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
So we look at.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,680
From the reverse of the heave position.

180
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
You can stand in.

181
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I get my scoop.

182
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
So we use the scoop.

183
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
And it over at will be both.

184
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,680
But if he stand, we're talking about in third.

185
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Right.

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,680
But there are some danger to associate with that.

187
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
So as opposed, it's just been.

188
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I can invert my knee inside like this.

189
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Very similar to a cave.

190
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
I see this like.

191
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
But I.

192
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
But I had.

193
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I got.

194
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Tell that he for scoops.

195
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Right.

196
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Tell that he for scoops.

197
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
I inverted my knee inside.

198
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
This would be our cave art position.

199
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
It's the same idea.

200
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I'm just trying to be on the.

201
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Other side of the leg.

202
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Because it's on the reverse.

203
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Tell the he decided not to go to the side.

204
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
So I get my scoop.

205
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
And I work this knee inside.

206
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Just like this.

207
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
So this is great because.

208
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
He goes to pressure.

209
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
And to me right now.

210
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
Especially because he had chest adjust.

211
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
It's going to run for.

212
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Right.

213
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
It really uses to make a lot of space.

214
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,680
And it's not super easy for him to disengage from.

215
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
And just having this in the side.

216
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,680
And it's important to me a lot of 50 50 transition.

217
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,680
And other options versus just inverting.

218
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,680
In this position as much less prone to back takes.

219
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,680
So I did like a version here.

220
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
You got to take things.

221
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
It's a.

222
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
So first.

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
So take my back.

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Versus when I do this way.

225
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Because I have that.

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Sheen in front of this.

227
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
You go through the same thing.

228
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
You just really can't do that.

229
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
I have the spring.

230
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Right here.

231
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
So I'm kind of using this side of my foot.

232
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
At the right here.

233
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm pulling.

234
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm going to try to keep my.

235
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
You might check.

236
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm not standing away.

237
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
But to look.

238
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
It's more of like a.

239
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
The chest.

240
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
So the first off.

241
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
And then you go to stop.

242
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
This is left for for free.

243
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
Because I do have the under.

244
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
But this.

245
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Inside.

246
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
And through my knee behind.

247
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Like a lot.

248
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
My legs.

249
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
And then saddle.

250
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
The problem with standing saddle.

251
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Special with it.

252
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
And it's kind of easy for him to.

253
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
So clear my knees.

254
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,680
He says to push my knees down.

255
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Now I'm not super tired.

256
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I couldn't have been trouble.

257
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
But what I will do here is I will immediately.

258
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
The invertean side.

259
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
They're just using to take it down.

260
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Now you're saddle.

261
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Potentially.

262
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Put this side.

263
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
So that is an option.

264
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
Throwing a leg.

265
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
So right the saddle.

266
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
When I do that.

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
It's really important.

268
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
That.

269
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
I use this.

270
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Both.

271
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
The point third side.

272
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
Don't just throw my legs like this.

273
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
We're going to stuff me on our shoulders.

274
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
I use this up the point.

275
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
My right knee.

276
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Close behind his knees.

277
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
I'm kind of supporting this calf.

278
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
I'll talk in my quad.

279
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
And I lock and I spin my head inside.

280
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
And I hit my.

281
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Inversion to take it down.

282
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,680
But my preferred option here is to go to back side 50.

283
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,680
So it's very similar.

284
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I hit the same.

285
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
When you're side dead.

286
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,680
But instead this leg would come out and around.

287
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
And throw it back.

288
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
So I'm just getting the second foot on his stomach.

289
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
And I hope this right here.

290
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
And put this leg.

291
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Now it's very important.

292
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm not just inverting.

293
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
With the soup.

294
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Because now we need to switch.

295
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
We're going to go back.

296
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Because I have a scoop.

297
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
I don't have the heel.

298
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,680
I'm kind of stepping hard.

299
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,680
So as soon as that leg comes inside.

300
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm going to make a transition.

301
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
To an overrack.

302
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
So I invert the knee.

303
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
I put the foot on the stomach.

304
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
I go hand behind his hamstring.

305
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
And leg comes here.

306
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Because I don't want to go back.

307
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
I'm going to step with that left leg.

308
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
If I just kind of didn't do it.

309
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,680
He would back step.

310
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
And square up with me.

311
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Now I'm going to stand in 50 50 with the scoop.

312
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,680
I go to the back.

313
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
And I overrack.

314
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
Just potential.

315
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Kind of this show.

316
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
This is there.

317
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Versus.

318
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Here.

319
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
Put on the stomach.

320
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
It goes behind.

321
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I sewed this inside.

322
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I immediately come back out to my overrack.

323
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
And because I have this in the underneath.

324
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I just forced him.

325
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Back side 50 50.

326
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,680
We would be with the overrack, which is going to result in me catching the heel.

327
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,680
So using the scoop.

328
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
To our near side cake guard.

329
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Like this.

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
Put on the stomach.

331
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
And you have the knee.

332
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
Come around and take the overrack out.

333
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,680
And I force him to this back side 50.

334
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
But I can do this.

335
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
Like I said, we're going to overrack.

336
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
It's going to be slightly harder.

337
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
It's like the overrack.

338
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
So even version of the little bit harder to get.

339
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,680
But instead of getting the scoop, I have the overrack.

340
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
And the stance.

341
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this inside.

342
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Like I'm going to do the same thing.

343
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
Like I'm going to do it.

344
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Like I said, whatever it is, is I'm going to use my foot behind this hamstring.

345
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
And I'm going to turn my leg away.

346
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
And I get the ball on my foot.

347
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,680
I'm the back of the hamstring.

348
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
And that's going to help me pull myself through.

349
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Almost like an inversion.

350
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
But I'm doing this.

351
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Right here. So see how my toes are gripping the back of his hamstring.

352
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
And my chin is still on the outside.

353
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
And now we do the same thing.

354
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,680
We're going to throw a back side 50, 50.

355
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Again, with the overrack and heel.

356
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
And it goes behind the hamstring.

357
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
So you see a lot of these positions.

358
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
We're having different ways to kind of bring ourselves to the same spot.

359
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
So I think in jujitsu in general.

360
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
It's a good strategy.

361
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
We're having multiple ways to get the one position.

362
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,680
We're going to feel very strong.

363
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,680
So I have this overrack and would hide by the knee.

364
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,680
And I do this so my foot was behind like that.

365
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
I'm using my outside leg for momentum.

366
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
But I didn't get that front of place.

367
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
It'd be kind of awkward.

368
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
I lose a good reaction.

369
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
So foot comes around just like this.

370
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
So I'm kind of stepping in the back of the hamstring.

371
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Grab now foot makes face.

372
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Throw.

373
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Now I continue the version.

374
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
Catch the heel. That's I think you 50 with the heel.

375
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
And we'll call it.

376
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
We don't finish.

377
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
All right.

378
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
So knee or side pay guard.

379
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Very similar to the rest of the heel.

380
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
Very similar feel.

381
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm just kind of converting that knee to the outside of the shin.

382
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,680
It offers up all for us additional framing and protective of this against tactics.

383
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,680
All right.

384
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
So we went over using a last of the hit on version.

385
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
So very similar.

386
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,680
We can use a last of the set up on your side k-guard.

387
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
It's not even a set of far side k-guard.

388
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Which we didn't really cover in this structure and look.

389
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
If you guys are watching this.

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Probably if heard that position.

391
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Far side k-guard and a lap of job.

392
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
I mean popular foot.

393
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,680
So we can track the knee or side of the position.

394
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
So same thing.

395
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
The pose in the head or hip are free.

396
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I get my glasses.

397
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,680
So I want to make sure.

398
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm using my toes.

399
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
I just touched the face face.

400
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,680
That's what the kick from what.

401
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Now I was opposed to just inverted.

402
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
I can take my leg out.

403
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I can go to the same head of k-guard position.

404
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
With the last of the hit.

405
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
So I have my body.

406
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
I can get my direction.

407
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
Now I can just throw a leg all the way through.

408
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,680
And we're the same back side position.

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
So this time I'm using a scoop.

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,680
I will let go.

411
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
These slowers of the heel.

412
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
But just like when we did before.

413
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I can go back and walk.

414
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
So we come into the knee cut.

415
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I make some space.

416
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
As opposed to going scoop.

417
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,680
And just grab a side and use this as a space.

418
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
Now it's going to go through.

419
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
Go for the leg.

420
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
Boom.

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
All right.

422
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,680
So I'm using that for the exact same thing.

423
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
So it's important with this grip.

424
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,680
I should really pull him on top of me.

425
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,680
To kind of force us into the position.

426
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,680
So I make the space.

427
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,680
I get this like out.

428
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
There'll be either here or overhook.

429
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,680
And I'm really rotating my knee out with some toolings.

430
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,680
And to me.

431
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
So I can off balance.

432
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
So we're going to do that with this.

433
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Now I will make space for all my back side position.

434
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,680
And now here we are with the heel exposed.

435
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
We can also.

436
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm not going to talk about this too much.

437
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Just because we discussed it all in the structural.

438
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
But I posted it on the hip.

439
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
I've made a space right here.

440
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I get this like out.

441
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Still like in both of the right leg.

442
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
You search to step that back.

443
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
A lot of times the fall leg will be going available.

444
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
So I have a lot of stuff.

445
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,680
A lot of times the fall leg will be going available.

446
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
So I have a lot of stuff.

447
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
But I'm going to scoop on the far leg.

448
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
And now I'm going to start a regular kick bar.

449
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,680
We're going to break the knee down for back side to the tip.

450
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,680
So we'll show that again.

451
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
So here.

452
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm going to take the leg out.

453
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
You go to this.

454
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
We start to step back.

455
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
And I think I can't get that leg.

456
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,680
I can just hook my toes on this claw.

457
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,680
And pull my head to this leg.

458
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Now, I'll make space.

459
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
I'll have to put your four.

460
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Now we're just the right away.

461
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
I have good connection.

462
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
I'll throw another leg behind.

463
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,680
And now we're just in a regular kick bar.

464
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
I can do back side.

465
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I have the 50.

466
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
We're going to get 50.

467
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
All right.

468
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
So we can go both directions with that.

469
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,680
You know, the near side or the far side.

470
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I feel this is probably one of the better controls.

471
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
We covered in the structural.

472
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Getting that last.

473
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
So I can really again.

474
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Because I have the foot.

475
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Pressing up the chest.

476
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
I am making space while still being able to draw.

477
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm in the safe way to the near side.

478
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
And the far side.

479
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
All right, guys.

480
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
So I hope you enjoyed the instructional.

481
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,680
You guys can see how we went over.

482
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Like our base positioning.

483
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,680
How properly you've heard.

484
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,680
And then once we actually heard what we're supposed to do in that position.

485
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
You guys see we kind of get to the same spot.

486
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Was that the time.

487
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,680
And then we have all these different leg attack.

488
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Bad attack.

489
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
Options from there.

490
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,680
And then finally we talked about secondary options.

491
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
Going to different cave yards.

492
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Going to the false reefers.

493
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
Pretty popular these days.

494
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
If you guys got my first instructional.

495
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Which is 50 50 and I'm 50 50.

496
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,680
You're going to see there's a big connection to what we've covered in that.

497
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
And so there was some crossover.

498
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,680
But you guys will see like a lot of positions we did today.

499
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm going to kind of put us right in that.

500
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Those types of 50 50 positions that we've covered in the first instructional.

501
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,680
So they really pair and all together.

502
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,680
You guys will be able to use them.

503
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,680
And then they'll get to work off each other and improve in both areas.
